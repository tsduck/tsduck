    //!
    //! An efficient TSDuck-specific TS packets encapsulation in a PID.
    //! @ingroup mpeg
    //!
    //! An instance of this class encapsulates several PID's from the
    //! input transport stream into one single output PID. Functionally,
    //! this is a subset of the features of T2-MI but much more lightweight
    //! and significantly faster to process.
    //!
    //! Encapsulation format (plain)
    //! ----------------------------
    //! In the output elementary stream (ES), all input TS packets are
    //! contiguous, without encapsulation. The initial 0x47 synchronization
    //! byte is removed. Only the remaining 187 bytes are encapsulated.
    //!
    //! In the output PID, the packetization is similar to sections, with
    //! 187-bytes packets instead of sections. The Payload Unit Start
    //! Indicator (PUSI) bit is set in the header of TS packets containing
    //! the start of an encapsulated packet. When the PUSI bit is set, the
    //! first byte of the payload is a "pointer field" to the beginning of
    //! the first encapsulated packet.
    //!
    //! Due to the overhead of the TS header, the number of output packets
    //! is slightly larger than the input packets. The input streams must
    //! contain a few null packets to absorb the extra output packets. For
    //! this reason, null packets (PID 0x1FFF) are never encapsulated.
    //!
    //! Encapsulation format (PES)
    //! --------------------------
    //! When selecting the PES encapsulation the same plain elementary
    //! stream is used, but with a PES envelope. This reduces the payload
    //! size, but makes the outer encapsulation more transparent. The full
    //! overhead is around 14-20% of more data.
    //!
    //! The PES envelope uses a KLVA SMPTE-336M encapsulation to insert the
    //! inner payload into one private (testing) key. Each TS packet contains
    //! only one key, with a size no larger than the payload of one TS packet.
    //! So each PES packet fits into a single TS packet.
    //!
    //! The SMPTE-336M encapsulation implemented can be either the
    //! asynchronous (without timestamps) or the synchronous (with PTS).
    //! The latter consumes more space (+10 bytes), and it's only useful when
    //! it's needed to remux the encapsulated stream with an external tool
    //! that requires to use PTS marks. No other advantages are provided.
    //!
    //! Two variant strategies are implemented. The FIXED mode uses the
    //! short (7-bit) BER encoding. This limits the PES payload to a maximum
    //! of 127 bytes. And the adaptation field of the outer packet is
    //! enlarged with some stuff. However, the advantage is that the PES
    //! is sufficient small to include more data in the outer TS packet.
    //! This reduces the possibility than some external processing will
    //! split the outer packet in two to accommodate the entire PES data.
    //!
    //! The VARIABLE mode does not impose this restriction and outer
    //! packets are filled to the maximum. The drawback is that sometimes
    //! the long form of BER encoding is used with two bytes and others
    //! the short form with one byte. Furthermore, this increases the chances
    //! that some external processing occupies two outer packets for the
    //! same inner PES packet. Still, support for those split PES packets
    //! is included. The only requirement is that the 26|27 PES+KLVA header
    //! is inserted in the first packet (with PUSI on). The remaining
    //! payload can be distributed in the following TS packets.
    //!
    //! The PES envelope has an overhead of 26|27|36|37 bytes based on:
    //! - 9 bytes for the PES header.
    //! - 0|5 bytes for the PTS (only in synchronous mode)
    //! - 0|5 bytes for the Metadata AU Header (only in synchronous mode)
    //! - 16 bytes for the UL key
    //! - 1|2 bytes for the payload size (BER short or long format)
    //!
    //! To enable the use of the Synchronous encapsulation is required
    //! to use PCRs and provide one offset. This value (positive or negative)
    //! will be added to the PCR to compute the PTS. Recommended values are
    //! between -90000 and +90000 (-1,+1 second). If you use negative values
    //! then you can restore in advance the encapsulated stream after
    //! remuxing. However, this will be valid only if you use an external
    //! tool to remux. If you're unsure, then don't enable it.
    //!
    //! A warning about the Synchronous mode:
    //!  At start the PTS marks can't be in synch with the target pcr-pid.
    //!  This is because the PCR value isn't readed at start. But the PTS
    //!  is required to be in all PES packets of the encapsulation.
    //!  So, it's recommended to discard the outcoming stream until valid
    //!  PTS values appear in the encapsulated stream.
    //!
    //! In order to correctly identify the encapsulated PES stream, it is
    //! recommended to include in the PMT table a format identifier
    //! descriptor for "KLVA" (0x4B4C5641); and use the associated metadata
    //! for the stream type based on the selected Sync/Async mode:
    //!  - Asynchronous mode: Private Type (0x06)
    //!  - Synchronous mode: Metadata Type (0x15)
    //!
    //! Example (Asynchronous):
    //! @code
    //! tsp ...
    //!     -P encap -o 7777 --pes-mode ...
    //!     -P pmt -s 100 -a 7777/0x06 --add-programinfo-id 0x4B4C5641
    //!     ...
    //! @endcode
    //! where the outer PID is 7777 and the attached service is 100.
    //!
    //! Example (Synchronous):
    //! @code
    //! tsp ...
    //!     -P encap -o 7777 --pes-mode ... --pcr-pid 101 --pes-offset=-50000
    //!     -P pmt -s 100 -a 7777/0x15 --add-programinfo-id 0x4B4C5641
    //!     ...
    //! @endcode
    //! where the outer PID is 7777, the pid 101 carries the PCR of the service,
    //! the attached service is 100 and the PTS is advanced around half second.

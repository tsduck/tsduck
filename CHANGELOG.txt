TSDUCK CHANGE LOG AND RELEASE NOTES

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.35-3236

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "dump" to dump TS packets (similar to command "tsdump").
  * Added experimental plugin "feed" to extract an encapsulated transport
    stream from a feed.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Improvements in syntax of XML patch files:
    - Match elements with an attribute value being different from something.
      Example: <PAT transport_stream_id="!1">
    - Delete a higher-level parent on a structure match.
      Example: <PMT> <component stream_type="0x06" x-node="delete(PMT)"/>
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --adaptation-field in "tsdump".
    - Unix: Option --disable-multicast-loop in output plugin "ip".
    - Windows: Option --disable-multicast-loop in "tstabdump", input plugin
      "ip", plugins "cutoff" and "mpeinject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issues #1203 and #1205: On Arm64 Linux system with CPU below Armv8.2
    (typical example: Raspberry Pi 4), all executables crashed with "illegal
    instruction" error.
  * Fixed issue #1219: On Windows, tuning to a DVB-S tuner without specifying
    the modulation (QPKS by default), crashed "tsp" and "tsscan".
  * Fixed issue #1227: When garbage input was interpreted as a DVB service
    prominence descriptor, an infinite loop could occur.
  * Fixed issue #1234: Option --linger did not work with plugins "srt".
  * In "dektec" input and output plugins, several options and modes were
    defined but did not support MPEG-TS format. Trying to use them resulted
    in various errors from the Dektec library. All these options were removed
    (tracked in issue #550).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.34-3194

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tslatencymonitor" to monitor the latency between two input
    sources (code contribution from Amos Cheung).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * On Arm64 platforms, Linux and macOS, improved performances on data
    serialization, CRC32 for all MPEG sections, AES, SHA-1, SHA-256
    (when the corresponding accelerated instructions are available).
  * Using "-P tables --log", without "--output", the logged lines are reported
    through the general logger of "tsp" instead of being output to stdout.
  * The plugin "pes", with option --trace-packets, detects and reports invalid
    PES packets (e.g. truncated).
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --no-deep-duplicate in "tstables" and plugin "tables".
    - Option --accelerated in "tscrc32".
    - Option --ignore-crc32 in "tstabdump".
    - Option --patch-xml and --section-number in plugin "sections".
    - Options --lazy-schedule-update, --synchronous-versions in plugin
      "eitinject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In plugin "eitinject", when a event was 64 days or more in the future,
    invalid EIT schedule sections were generated. Now, these events are
    discarded (an EPG can be only 64 days deep).
  * Fixed issue #1191: Incorrect display of some HEVC sequence parameter
    set analysis in plugin "pes".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.33-3131

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tscrc32" to manually compute CRC32 as used in MPEG sections.
  * Added command "tstestecmg" to create an artificial load on an ECMG.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Ported TSDuck to FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - The packet processing plugin "file" now supports all options of the
      output plugin "file".
    - Option --max-files in output and packet processing plugin "file".
    - Option --set-label on plugin 'svresync".
    - Options --custom-tag, --live-extra-segments, --slice-only in output
      plugin "hls".
    - Options --log-message-count, --synchronous-log, --timed-log to "tsecmg".
    - Option --cumulative in plugin "analyze".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * When an invalid / truncated section had a very large declared length,
    intermediate valid sections were ignored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.32-2973

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tsvatek" and output plugin "vatek" to handle modulators
    based on VATek chips.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In "mpeinject" plugin, it is now possible to multiplex several input UDP
    stream into one single output MPE PID.
  * Added support for VVC, EVC, LCEVC, AVS3 and other new codecs descriptors
    (code contribution from Paul Higgs).
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Options --alt-group-id, --alt-language, --alt-name, --alt-type in input
      plugin "hls".
    - Options --merge, --attributes-merge, --sort, --uncomment in "tsxml".
    - Options --sort-languages, --sort-pids in plugin "pmt".

      "tspacketize", "tstabcomp", plugin "inject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #1070: In the plugin "scrambler", do not fail at startup if
    the bitrate is not immediately known. Simply wait for the bitrate to be
    known before scheduling crypto-periods and ECM's.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.31-2754

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In "dektec" output plugin, option "--input-modulation" now handles DVB-T2.
  * Added environment variable TSPLUGINS_STACK_SIZE to specify non-default
    stack size for "tsp" plugin threads.
  * In plugin "sections", the options --tid-remove, --tid-ext-remove,
    --etid-remove, --version-remove were renamed without -remove suffix to
    highlight the fact that they can be used to remove or keep sections.
  * The plugin "bitrate_monitor" now reports the net bitrate (without null
    packets) in addition to the global bitrate.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Options --no-bitrate, --align-first-segment in output plugin "hls".
    - Options --json-udp, --json-tcp, --json-buffer-size, --json-tcp-keep,
      --json-udp-local, --json-udp-ttl to "tsanalyze", "tscmp", "tsdektec",
      "tsxml", plugins "analyze", "splicemonitor".
    - Options --section-content, --section-mask in "tstables", plugins
      "sections", "tables".

    - Option --rs204 in output plugin "ip".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #959: In the plugin "merge", the merged EIT PID was not
    correctly rebuilt when the merged stream contained EIT's.
  * Fixed issue #991: In TS analysis, when an audio, subtitles or teletext PID
    had multiple languages, only the first one was reported in the analysis.
  * Fixed issue #1010: The input plugins "http" and "hls" left obsolete cookies
    files in /tmp on Linux and macOS.
  * In "tscmp" with option "--subset", failed to report the last hole when
    it extended up to the end of the primary file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.30-2709

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The bitrate evaluation has been modified in the plugin "analyze". When
    there is no hardware-based ("dvb", "dektec") or clock-based ("ip")
    evaluation of the bitrate, all bitrate computations are based on the
    average bitrate, all over the capture, based on PCR's. Previously, the
    base was the current "tsp" bitrate, ie. a PCR-based evaluation from the
    last part of the stream only.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --event in output plugin "hls".
    - Option --extract-tcp-stream in "tspcap".
    - Options --carrier-only and --roll-off in output plugin "dektec".
    - Option --periodic-command in plugin "bitrate_monitor".
    - Option --final-wait in "tsp".
    - Option --user-agent in input plugins "hls", "http".
    - Option --json-line in input and output plugins "srt".
    - Option --select-commands in plugin "splicemonitor".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed bash completion incorrect behavior after plugin option (-I, -P, -O).
  * Fixed spurious new lines on standard output in plugin "splicemonitor" with
    options --display-commands and --json.
  * Fixed issue #906: In output plugin "hls", live playlists were marked as
    event playlist.
  * In "tsscan", the handling of --min-strength was broken.
  * Fixed a segmentation fault crash in various plugins ("svremove", "sdt",
    "nit", etc). The crash occured when a table which is transparently passed
    in a modified PID changes its version. For instance, if the SDT Actual
    needs to be modified, all SDT Other in the same PID are transparently
    passed. If one of these SDT Other changed its version, "tsp" crashed.
  * Fixed issue #939: On Windows, opening TS files with non-ASCII name failed.
  * Fixed issue #945: In plugin "rmorphan", the predefined ISDB or ATSC PID's
    were considered as orphan, even with --isdb or --atsc options.
  * Fixed issue #948: Fixed truncated HTTP transfers when the server sends
    very small chunks of data (observed with Python http.server, not seen
    on usual production servers such as Apache or IIS).
  * Fixed issue #950: Extraction of T2MI streams failed in case of duplicate
    packets or packets without payload in the outer transport stream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.29-2647

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tseit" (test EIT manipulation scripts).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * All bitrate computations are now implemented using 64-bit floating-point
    values. Previously, a fixed-point representation was used. The strict
    accuracy was better but integer overflows in intermediate computations
    occurred from time to time, leading to incorrect evaluations.
  * On Unix (using libcurl), when an SSL/TLS connection fails with a CA
    certificate issue, retry with an updated list of CA certificates from
    https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem. Transient issues have been noticed with
    Let's Encrypt CA around the certification renewal periods. The updated
    list is saved in $HOME/.tscacert.pem and is updated at most once a day.
  * In commands "tsp" and "tsswitch", the alternative syntax "--input"
    (for "-I"), "--processor" (for "-P") and "--output" (for "-O") are no
    longer accepted. They were rarely used and created confusion with
    potential equivalent options in plugins.
  * Bash completion support has been added for all TSDuck commands and
    plugins (plugin names, command and plugin options, enumeration values).
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Options --section-number, --negate-section-number, --invalid-sections,
      --only-invalid-sections in "tstables" and plugin "tables".
    - Options --bufferapi, --final-statistics and --statistics-interval in
      plugin "srt". Option --messageapi is now enabled by default.
    - Options --json and --json-line in plugin "splicemonitor".
    - Option --event-user-data in "tsswitch".
    - Options --dvb-simulcrypt and --no-pager in "tspcap".
    - Options --emmg-client-id, --emmg-data-id, --first-date, --first-packet,
      --first-timestamp, --last-date, --last-packet, --last-timestamp,
      --tcp-emmg-mux, --udp-emmg-mux in "pcap" input plugin.
    - Option --no-replicate-duplicated in "tsfixcc" and plugin "continuity".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed incorrect EIT Schedule regeneration on event change in plugin
    "eitinject".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.28-2548

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tspcap", a simple tool to analyze pcap files (Wireshark).
  * Added plugin "pcredit" (edit PCR, PTS and DTS values in various ways).
  * Added input and output plugin "rist" (Reliable Internet Stream Transport).
  * On macOS, all shared objects, including plugins, are now named '.dylib',
    the standard macOS naming, instead of '.so', a Linux naming.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --install-dvb-firmware in "tsconfig".
    - Option --local-interface in plugin "srt" (input and output).
    - Options --abnt, --atsc, --isdb in "tsscan".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #791: In plugin "merge", the PCR were not correcty adjusted
    when the input PCR had a discontinuity in the future.
  * Fixed issue #830: Incorrect formatting of HEVC HRD parameters.
  * Fixed issue #830: Incorrect handling of PES packets with 1 or 2 bytes in
    last TS packet.
  * Fixed issue #840: In "tsscan", the --lnb and --satellite-number parameters
    were not correctly passed when scanning each transport.
  * Fixed issue #841: In "tsscan", when generating channel files, the
    frequency was incorrectly set to zero on satellite networks.
  * In "tsp", the global default options for plugins (--atsc, --isdb, etc)
    were not correctly passed to plugins "tables" and "psi".
  * Fixed issue #856: The plugin "psi" with JSON output failed when restarted.
  * Fixed issue #861: On Linux and macOS, when plugins start and stop processes
    (typically "tsswitch" with several "fork" plugins), file descriptors were
    not properly segmented between processes, resulting in plugins failing to
    stop.
  * With "--initial-input-packets N --add-start-stuffing N", tsp could not
    start as long as at least one packet was received from the input plugin.
  * Fixed issue #871: In plugin "eitgenerator", the version number of the EIT
    sections were not correctly updated on section content change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tsfclean" (cleanup TS files).
  * Added plugin "pcrcopy" (copy and synchronize PCR from one PID to another).
  * Added plugin "svresync" (resynchronize the clock of a service based on
    another service).
  * Added plugin "pidshift" (shift selected PID's forward inside the TS).
  * Added plugin "eitinject" (generate and inject EIT's inside the TS).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added support for Dektec Ethernet devices (eg. DTA-2162).
  * The plugin "zap" can now select more than one service.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:

    - Option --system-synchronous in plugin "timeref".
    - Options --no-repeat, --payload-and, --payload-or, --payload-xor in packet
      processing plugin "craft".
    - Option --multiple-files in plugin "pes".
    - Options --apdu and --continue-on-error in "tssmartcard".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #764: SCTE 35 splice information tables were not correctly
    deserialized when the command length field was the legacy value 0xFFF.
  * Fixed issue #771: Multi-standard ASI Dektec devices surch as DTA-2174B
    did not work properly.
  * Fixed a rare issue where tsp with option --add-input-stuffing silently
    terminated after some long random time.
  * Fixed issue #811: In plugin "merge", the options --drop and --pass were
    not correctly handled when they had one single value (not a range).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.26-2344

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added input and output plugins "memory" (direct application interaction).
  * Added input plugin "pcap" (Wireshark capture files).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Resource monitoring of "tsp" and "tsswitch" (option --monitor) is now
    configurable using XML files and alarm commands can be triggered on
    CPU or memory misbehavior.
  * When the environment variable TSDUCK_NO_USER_CONFIG is defined to some
    non-empty value, the user's configuration file is not loaded.
  * Bitrates are now handled, entered and computed with one decimal digit.
    The increased precision was required by some modulations.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --event-code in plugins "mpe", "psi" and "tables".
    - Options --min-bitrate and --min-inter-packet in plugin "spliceinject".
    - Option --java and --python in "tsconfig".

    - Options --event-command, --event-udp, --event-ttl and --event-local-address
      to "tsswitch".
    - Options --max-size and --max-duration in output plugin "file".
    - Options --multiple and --restart-delay in output plugin "srt".

      The address:port parameter and the --rendezvous options are now legacy.
    - Option --ignore-leap-seconds in "tsanalyze", "tsdate", "tsp", "tspsi",
      "tstabcomp", "tstabdump", "tstables" and plugins "analyze", "psi",
      "tables".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In the display of SCTE 35 splice information tables, the UTC times in the
    splice_schedule() commands were incorrectly displayed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.25-2236

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "splicemonitor" (monitor SCTE-35 splice commands).
  * Added input and output plugins "memory" for C++/Java/Python developers.
  * Java bindings have been added for high-level functions of the TSDuck
    library. All "tsp" features are now available from Java.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Everywhere an input XML file name is expected, it is possible to specify
    an "inline XML content" directly. The string is recognized as an inline
    XML content and not a file name when it starts with "<?xml".
  * In most utilities or plugins where XML files can be read or written, it is
    possible to specify an automated XML-to-JSON conversion and read or write
    JSON input or output.
  * Everywhere XML or JSON output can be produced, it is possible to log
    the XML or JSON data on one line using options --log-xml-line (or
    --xml-line) and --json-line. Java or Python applications which intercept
    messages from a TSProcessor can more easily grab the complete output data.
  * HEVC video attributes are now extracted and reported.
  * DVB-T/T2 and ISDB-T are no longer enumeration values ("6-MHz", "8-MHz",
    etc). They are arbitrary values in Hz. The previous values in command
    line are still accepted for compatibility.
  * In plugin "bitrate_monitor", the alarm command receives more parameters.
  * The plugin "reduce" can now reduce the bitrate using PCR and VBR.
  * The command "tstabcomp" can use the standard input and output for XML or
    binary section files.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --save-es in plugin "pes".
    - Option --extended-info in "tslsdvb" (--verbose no longer displays the
      extremely verbose graph, use --extended-info for this).
    - Option --usa in "tsanalyze", "tsdate", "tsp", "tspsi", "tsscan",
      "tstabcomp", "tstabdump", "tstables", "tsterinfo" and plugins "dvb",
      "analyze", "psi", "tables".
    - Option --abnt in "tsanalyze", "tsdate", "tsp", "tspsi", "tstabcomp",
      "tstabdump", "tstables" and plugins "analyze", "psi", "tables".
    - Options --fixed-proportion, --input-bitrate, --packet-window, --pcr-based,
      --reference-pcr-pid, --target-bitrate, --time-window in plugin "reduce".
    - Option --json-line in "tsanalyze", "tscmp", "tsdektec" and plugin
      "analyze".
    - Options --log-xml-line and --log-hexa-line to "tstables" and plugin
      "tables".
    - Options --log-xml-line, --strict-xml, --text-output, --xml-output to
      "tspsi" and plugin "psi".
    - Options --json, --json-line, --from-json and --x2j-* to "tsxml".
    - Options --json-output, --log-json-line, --rewrite-json and --x2j-* to
      "tstables" and plugin "tables".
    - Options --json-output, --log-json-line and --x2j-* to "tspsi" and plugin
      "psi".
    - Options --json, --from-json and --x2j-* to "tstabcomp".
    - Option --json to "tspacketize".
    - Option --default-pds to "tsanalyze", "tsscan" and plugin "analyze".
    - Option --log-hexa-line to plugin "mpe".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * The global "tsp" options --default-pds and --hf-band-region were not
    correctly passed to the plugins.
  * Fixed issue #719: The option --default-pds was not correctly used in
    "tsscan" when looking for logical channel numbers in streams with invalid
    signalization (missing private data specifier descriptor).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.24-2106

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "stats" (report various statistics on PID's and labels).
  * Added command "tsxml" to test the validation and patches of XML files.
  * For developers who use the TSDuck library on Linux and macOS, the new
    command "tsconfig" generates the various build options for the applications
    depending on the current operating system.
  * Python bindings have been added for high-level functions of the TSDuck
    library. All "tsp" features are now available from Python.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In all commands and plugins which produce "normalized" output, a JSON output
    format has been added. The traditional "normalized" format was designed for
    use with grep & sed and dates back from a time where JSON did not exist.
  * In all commands and plugins which define the option --format (file format),
    the new value "RS204" designates TS files containing 204-byte packets with
    trailing Reed-Solomon code.
  * In plugin "pcrextract", the default CSV separator is now "," instead of ";".
  * Added "default.time" to configuration file (see option --time-reference).
  * General improvement of ISDB support for Brazil and the Philippines:
    - Default character set, time reference and HF bands.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --log-plugin-index in "tsp".
    - Option --subtitles-pid in plugin "zap".
    - Option --json in "tscmp" and "tsdektec".
    - Options --json and --deterministic in "tsanalyze" and plugin "analyze".
    - Options --save-pes, --intra-image, --h26x-default-format in plugin "pes".
    - Options --intra-close and --max-extra-duration to output plugin "hls".
    - Options --bitrate, --acceleration-threshold, --incremental-pcr-restamp,
      --no-smoothing, --pcr-reset-backwards in plugin "merge".
    - Options --atsc, --isdb, --japan to "tsdate".
    - Options --brazil, --philippines and --time-reference in "tsanalyze",
      "tsdate", "tsp", "tspsi", "tstabcomp", "tstabdump", "tstables" and
      plugins "analyze", "psi", "tables".
    - Options --and, --tid-ext-remove, --version-remove, --reverse-etid in
      plugin "sections".
    - Options --add-start-stuffing and --add-stop-stuffing in plugin "file".
    - Option --patch-xml to plugins "bat", "cat", "nit", "pat", "pmt", "sdt".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #646: Several commands and plugins crashed in case of invalid
    PES packets when the specified PES length was not zero but lower than the
    PES header size.
  * Fixed issue #651: When fixing the PCR's in the "merge" plugin, there was a
    slow drift on merged PCR values after several hours.
  * Fixed issue #653: When serializing NIT, SDT and BAT, the maximum size of
    of a section was 4096 bytes as for all private sections (non-MPEG) but DVB
    specifies that these three specific tables shall not exceed 1024 bytes per
    section.
  * Fixed issue #664: Due to a probably long-standing regression, the command
    "tsterinfo" was no longer able to guess modulation parameters from bitrates.
  * Fixed issue in "tsp": When Ctr-C was in the startup phase (before the first
    packets were received), "tsp" hanged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.23-1964

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * At most once a day, the "tsp" command interrogates GitHub in the background
    to check the availability of a new release of TSDuck. Define the environment
    variable TSDUCK_NO_VERSION_CHECK do disable this.
  * With commands and plugins which access the Internet such as the "http"
    plugin, the environment variables "http_proxy" and "https_proxy" are now
    used on Windows also.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #632: When the input plugin "http" was used with --ignore-errors
    and either --infinite or --repeat, restarting the plugin from "tspcontrol"
    entered an infinite loop.
  * Fixed issue #633: In version 3.22, a regression was introduced which crashed
    the plugin "fork" in the packet processor version ("-P fork").

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.22-1924

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * On Linux and macOS, the installation of TSDuck files are no longer all
    inside /usr/bin. Shared libraries are in /usr/lib, plugins are in
    /usr/lib/tsduck, configuration files are in /usr/share/tsduck. On macOS,
    /usr/local is used instead of /usr. On some 64-bit Linux distros,
    /usr/lib64 is used instead of /usr/lib.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The "tsp" command now keeps track of input time-stamps for each packet
    and propagate the information to all plugins (see improvement in plugin
    "pcrverify").
  * Most commands reading TS files can read M2TS files as well.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --format in "tsanalyze", "tsbitrate", "tscmp", "tsdate", "tsdump",
      "tspsi", "tstables", plugins "file", "fork" (input, output and packet
      processor) and plugins "merge", "mux".
    - Options --input-format and --output-format in "tsstuff".
    - Options --input-synchronous and --jitter-unreal in plugin "pcrverify".
    - Option --timestamp-priority in input plugins "ip" and "srt".
    - Option --size-of-packet in "tsftrunc".
    - Options --eit-normalization, --eit-base-date and --pack-and-flush in
      "tspacketize", "tstabcomp" and plugin "inject".
    - Option --pack-sections in plugin "mpeinject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #587: Due to an intermediate integer overflow, the report PCR
    jitters were sometimes completely incorrect.
  * Sections of some DVB, ATSC and ARIB tables, when serialized, were limited
    to 1024 bytes instead of 4096. Only MPEG-defined PSI sections should be
    limited to 1024 bytes.
  * Fixed issue #619: "tsecmg" failed to process an ECM request with crypto-
    period numbers wrapping over 0xFFFF (eg. CP = 0xFFFF and 0x0000).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    in global configuration file.
  * General improvement of Japanese TV support:
    - Japanese character sets as defined in ARIB STD-B24.
    - Partial ISDB signalization, as defined in ARIB STD-B10.
    - Option --japan triggers suitable defaults for Japanese TV.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:

      "tsscan" and plugins "aes", "clear", "descrambler", "inject", "nitscan",
      "pmt", "rmsplice", "scrambler", "sdt", "spliceinject", "svremove",
      "svrename", "teletext", "zap".
    - Option --drop-to-maintain-preload in output plugin "dektec".
    - Option --nit-scan in "tsscan" (UHF-band scan is no longer the default,
      exactly one of --nit-scan, --uhf-band, --vhf-band shall be specified).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #515: In some cases, when multi-section long tables were
    injected, after some time, sections were not always inserted in the
    increasing order of section numbers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.20-1686

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tspcontrol" to send control commands to a running "tsp".
  * Added input and output plugins "srt" for Secure Reliable Transport
    (code contribution from Anthony Delannoy). This plugin is not compiled
    on all platforms (subject to availability of libsrt).
  * For developers, the features of "tsp" and "tsswitch" are now easily
    accessible from the TSDuck library. See classes ts::TSProcessor and
    ts::InputSwitcher.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --control-port to "tsp" and other related --control options
    for use with the new command "tspcontrol".
  * Added option --eit-date-only to plugin "timeref".
  * Option --buffer-size-mb of "tsp" now accepts decimal values (eg. "0.5").
  * Added options --local-time-offset, --next-change, --next-time-offset,
    --only-country name and --only-region to plugin "timeref".
  * The command "tsdump" now displays the splice countdown when there is one.
  * Added options --has-splice-countdown, --splice-countdown,
    --min-splice-countdown and --max-splice-countdown to plugin "filter".
  * Added option --label-close to output plugin "hls".
  * Added option --ignore-absent to plugin "zap".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In input plugin "hls", when the sub-playlists or media segments had
    relative URI's with absolute file path, the sub-playlists or segments
    were not correctly loaded.
  * On Unix systems (Linux, macOS), the option --append was not correctly
    handled in plugin "file". The file was rewritten from the beginning.
  * In plugin "pes", when a NALunit contained more than one SEI message,
    only the first one was reported.
  * In plugin "spliceinject", the non-immediate time_signal() commands were
    immediately injected. Now, they are processed the same way as non-immediate
    splice_insert() commands.
  * In command "tsp", when the number of initial null packets (--add-start-
    stuffing) was larger than half the global buffer, the command terminated
    before having read the input (an end of file was incorrectly assumed).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.19-1516

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "timeshift" (delay packet transmission).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --receive-timeout to "tsp".
  * Added options --aes-cbc, --aes-ctr, --iv, --ctr-counter-bits,
    --output-cw-file to plugins "scrambler" and "descrambler".
  * Added option --swap-cw to plugin "descrambler".
  * Added default CAS selection options --default-cas-id, --conax, --irdeto,
    --mediaguard, --nagravision, --nds, --safeaccess, --viaccess, --widevine
    to "tspsi", "tstabdump", "tstables" and plugins "psi", "tables".
  * Added option --extensions to "tsversion" and "tstabcomp".
  * Complete ATSC signalization, as defined in A/65, is now supported.
  * NorDig-private descriptors are supported.
  * Added option --power-mode to "tsdektec" and output plugin "dektec".
  * Added options --build-service-list-descriptors and --default-service-type
    to plugin "nit".
  * Added options --start and --stop to plugin "trigger".
  * Added option --local-port to plugins "ip" (output) and "mpe".
  * Service id or name is now optional in plugin "svrename". When omitted, the
    default service is the first one in the PAT.
  * On Linux, multi-standard tuners are now supported (for instance tuners
    which support DVB-T and DVB-C). The options --delivery-system is used
    to select the appropriate type. Multi-standard tuners are not supported
    on Windows.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In plugin "hides", the bandwidth was incorrectly set to 5 MHz when 6 MHz
    was requested.
  * In plugin "continuity", packets were incorrectly detected as duplicate
    when they had the same continuity counter but distinct content.
  * Fixed HEVC_video_descriptor to latest version of ISO 13818-1 standard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.18-1360

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "craft" as input to build specifically crafted packets and as
    packet processor to similarly alter packets in transit.
  * Added plugin "trigger" which executes actions on selected labeled TS
    packets.
  * Added plugin "cutoff" which sets labels on TS packets upon reception of
    UDP messages.
  * Added plugin "psimerge" which merges PSI/SI from mixed streams.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --only-label to all packet processing plugins. There is a
    new possibility to mark individual packets with a label which can be
    reused in other plugins.
  * Added options --label, --set-label, --reset-label, --set-permanent-label,
    --reset-permanent-label, --nullified, --input-stuffing, --every, --interval
    to plugin "filter".
  * Added option --atsc to commands "tsanalyze", "tstables", "tspsi",
    "tstabdump", "tstabcomp" and plugins "analyze", "tables", "psi".
  * Added option --pes-offset to plugin "encap" (synchronous PES mode).
  * Added options --add-registration and --add-pid-registration to plugin
    "pmt". The option --add-programinfo-id is now deprecated.
  * Added option --eit to plugin "timeref".
  * Added option --tag to plugin "count".
  * Added options --single, --set-label and --reset-label to plugins "remap"
    and "duplicate".

    --set-label-go-below, --set-label-go-normal, --set-label-go-above to
    plugin "bitrate_monitor".
  * Added RTP support for output plugin "ip": added options --rtp,
    --payload-type, --pcr-pid, --ssrc-identifier and --start-sequence-number.
  * Added options --interleave, --label-base and --first-terminate to input
    plugin "file".
  * Added option --min-ms-interval to plugin "pcradjust".
  * Added options --preload-fifo, --maintain-preload, --preload-fifo-delay and
    --preload-fifo-percentage in output plugin "dektec".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed an issue while reading XML files: leading and trailing spaces were
    removed by default inside all text nodes.
  * Fixed input plugin "dektec": with satellite receivers, the LNB was not
    properly enabled.
  * In input plugin "hls", the cookies which were returned by a playlist were
    not passed to the next playlist or segment download.
  * In plugin "regulate" with option --pcr-synchronous, the stream was passed
    unregulated after 26.5 hours (a complete PCR cycle).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.17-1189

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In commands "tsanalyze", "tsdump", "tspsi", "tstabdump", "tstables", the
    display is now sent through a pager application (less/more) when the output
    device is a terminal. Added option --no-pager to disable this.
  * In the input plugin "hls", after loading a master playlist, if the selected
    media playlist is not found, try next one, etc.
  * Added option --evaluate-pcr-offset to plugin "pcrextract".
  * Added option --dvb-cissa to plugins "scrambler" and "descrambler".
  * Added options --pid and --tag to plugin "bitrate_monitor". The plugin can
    now also monitor the bitrate of the complete TS and can detect zero bitrate
    on the transport stream.
  * Added option --start-media-sequence to output plugin "hls".
  * Added option --pack-and-flush to "tstabcomp".
  * In various analysis commands and plugins, ATSC signalization is now known.
  * General list of improvements regarding tuners and scanning:
    - Added region-specific UHF/VHF frequency layouts in various commands and
      plugins. Added option --hf-band-region to plugins "dvb", "dektec" and
      commands "tsterinfo", "tsscan". Added option --default-region to command
      "tsterinfo".
    - The command "tsscan" can now perform VHF band scanning: added option
      --vhf-band. Offsets are no longer used by default: added option
      --use-offsets.
    - In plugin "dvb" and command "tsscan": Added --guard-interval values
      "1/128", "19/128", "19/256". Added --transmission-mode values "1K",
      "2K-interleaved", "4K-interleaved", "16K", "32K". Added --modulation
      values "16-APSK", "32-APSK" (DVB-S2). The option --channel-transponder
      now accepts ATSC channel ids (major.minor).
    - The old "zap" format which was inherited from some Linux scanning tools
      is no longer supported by TSDuck. Instead, a more generic and portable
      XML format is used. See the user's guide for more details. Impact:
      . In plugin "dvb" and command "tsscan": Added option --tuning-file,
        removed options --tune and --zap-config-file.
      . In plugin "nitscan" and command "tsscan", added options --save-channels
        and --update-channels.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed support for ATSC tuners on Windows.
  * In plugin "scrambler", fixed a crypto-period issue with option --cw-file
    and more than one CW.
  * Now accept to demux probably incorrect section muxing when a TS packet is
    such that 1) PUSI is set, 2) start of payload before the pointer field is
    unused (do not contain a valid section) and 3) starts with FF. This is a
    probably incorrect muxing which has been found on at least one satellite
    transponder.
  * Fixed bitrate computation based on PCR's. Null packets uselessly reset the
    bitrate computation and introduced a small bias. New computed values can be
    slightly different but more accurate.
  * Fixed various discrepancies in adjustment of continuity counters.
  * The option --default-charset was not always correctly used when compiling
    tables from XML.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.16-1108

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added input plugin "hls" to receive HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).
  * Added output plugin "hls" to generate HLS media segments and playlists.
  * Added plugin "pcradjust" to adjust PCR's according to a constant bitrate.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In all commands and plugins, when an option takes an integer value and can
    be present several times, it is now possible to specify ranges of values
    (e.g. "--pid 0-3" instead of "--pid 0 --pid 1 --pid 2 --pid 3").
  * Added option --pack to plugin "encap".
  * Added options --log, --log-size, --no-headers and --pid to "tsdump".
  * Added option --fill-eit to "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added options for Dektec demodulators in input plugin "dektec".
  * In plugin "rmsplice", immediate splice events are no longer ignored.
  * Added PES encapsulation mode in plugin "encap" (added option --pes-mode,
    added optional value in option --pack).
  * Added option --threshold4 in plugin "limit". The packet selection strategy
    was changed.
  * Added option --enforce-burst in output plugin "ip".
  * Implement guidelines from ETSI TR 101 211 when compiling EIT's.
  * In XML descriptions of NIT and BAT, it is now possible to specify a
    preferred section index for each TS.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In plugin "http", the option --receive-timeout was ignored.
  * In "tsanalyze" and plugin "analyze", section analysis was missing on some
    PID's (including EIT's).
  * On Linux with BusyBox environment, the --help options (and other paged
    commands) no longer fail due to unsupported option for less.
  * The order of combining diacritical characters was incorrectly handled in
    DVB tables with the default character set.
  * In plugin "scrambler" with option --cw-file, there was a crash at the end
    of the first crypto-period. This was a regression.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.15-1007

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tsswitch", a TS input switcher with remote control.
  * Added command "tsgenecm", generate one ECM using any DVB SimulCrypt ECMG.
  * Added plugin "limit" to limit the global TS bitrate.
  * Added plugin "duplicate" to duplicate one or more PID's.
  * Added plugins "encap" and "decap" to encapsulate and decapsulate PID's
    into one single tunnel PID.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The plugin "fork" can now be used as input and output plugin as well. When
    used as an input plugin (new), it reads packets from the command output.
  * Added option --ignore-errors to "tsbitrate" and plugin "pcrbitrate".
  * Added option --receive-timeout to "tstabdump" and plugins "dektec" (input),
    "ip" (input), "mpeinject".
  * Added options --udp-size, --min-udp-size, --max-udp-size, --net-size,
    --min-net-size, --max-net-size to plugin "mpe".
  * Added option --network-id to plugin "nitscan".
  * Added option --strict-xml to "tstabcomp", "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added option --max-packets to "tsdump".
  * The command "tsdump" can now accept multiple input files.
  * Added demodulator support in the input plugin "dektec" (e.g. DTA-2137).
  * Added options --audio-pid and --eit to plugin "zap".
  * Added option --sei-type to plugin "pes".
  * Added option --event-id to plugin "rmsplice".
  * Added the per-user configuration file $HOME/.tsduck to specify default or
    alternate options to various commands.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In XML documents which were generated by TSDuck, some characters were not
    properly escaped.
  * In "tsp", in case of output error, when a plugin was slowing down the
    playout speed (such as "regulate"), the command was slow to terminate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.14-894

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "sections".
  * Optional rebuild without teletext support (without plugin "teletext").

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --remove-stream-type to plugin "pmt".
  * Added options --network-name, --network-id and --nit-other to plugin "nit".
  * Added option --provider to plugin "svrename".
  * Added options --include-next and --exclude-current to commands "tstables"
    and "tspsi" and to plugins "tables" and "psi".
  * Added options --rewrite-binary and --rewrite-xml to command "tstables" and
    plugin "tables".
  * Added keywork "system" to option --start in plugin "timeref".
  * Added option --transparent to plugin "merge".
  * Added options --other, --ts-id, --original-network-id to plugin "sdt".
  * Added options --create, --create-after, --bitrate, --inter-packet to
    plugins "pat", "pmt", "bat", "sdt", "nit".
  * Added option --wide-display to command "tsanalyze" and plugin "analyze".
  * Added option --min-interval to command "tsstuff".
  * Added option --scte35 to plugin "pcrextract".
  * In plugin "inject", when all input files have specific repetition rates,
    it is no longer required to provide a bitrate for the PID. It is computed
    from the size and repetition rate of all sections.
  * Some performance improvement by removing processing which are used in debug
    or verbose mode only (options --debug and --verbose).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In plugin "merge", merging CAT's from two streams was incorrect
    (incorrect PID conflict detection and endless code loop).
  * On Windows, "tslsdvb" and "tshides" could crash when using a HiDes
    UT-100A (combined received / modulator).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.13-833

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added input plugin "http" to receive a transport stream using a URL.
  * Added support for HiDes UT-100C modulator device using utility "tshides"
    and output plugin "hides". Be sure to install the right device drivers
    from https://tsduck.io/download/hides/

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * With plugins "svremove", "svrename" and "tsrename", the removal or renaming
    now also apply to EIT's. The new option --ignore-eit can be used to prevent
    this.
  * The plugin "regulate" can now also use the PCR from the TS to regulate the
    transmission. Previously, the regulation was done on bitrate only. Added
    options are --pcr-synchronous, --pid-pcr and --wait-min.
  * The input plugin "ip" and the plugin "mpeinject" now accept the syntax
    'source-ip@multicast-ip:port' for source-specific multicast (SSM). As a
    side effect, the command "tstabdump" also accepts this syntax when
    receiving PSI/SI tables.
  * Added option --tos to output plugin "ip".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Bug fix: Option --cleanup-private-descriptors in plugins "bat", "cat",
    "nit", "pmt" and "sdt" failed to cleanup contiguous private descriptors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.12-778

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "merge" which merges two transport streams.
  * On Windows, portable packages are now built for users without admin
    privilege.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --realtime to "tsp". This option selects appropriate default
    options when operating on real-time streamings. The "default defaults"
    remain appropriate for offline processing, such as working on transport
    streams files. This option is also automatically set by some plugins which
    are designed for real-time streaming ("dvb", "ip", dektec", "play",
    "regulate", "mpeinject").
  * The option --reuse-port is now on by default on all commands and plugins
    which use it. A new option --no-reuse-port has been added everywhere to
    disable the option explicitly (although probably never used).
  * Added options --log-protocol and --log-data to "tsecmg", "tsemmg" and
    plugins "scrambler", "datainject".
  * Added options --udp and --unregulated to plugin "datainject".
  * Many more descriptors are supported. See the user's guide.
  * In "tsemmg", sending UDP data to a broadcast address was not allowed. Now
    it is possible to send data to a local broadcast address. Using routed
    broadcast remains not possible (because this is usually not a good thing
    to route broadcast).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * If an XML representation of a splice information table contained a
    splice_insert command, the <break_duration> structure was rejected when the
    event was marked as immediate.
  * In "tsemmg", the TCP disconnection of the MUX was not detected in a timely
    fashion when data was injected using UDP.
  * In "tsecmg", the option --max-comp-time was ignored.
  * Regression fix: In plugin "datainject", the section mode was no longer
    handled correctly since version 3.10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.11-715

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added utility "tsemmg", an EMMG simulator for MUX integration testing.
  * Added plugin "spliceinject" to inject SCTE 35 splice information in real
    time.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --sync-layout, --dump-datagram, --dump-udp, --dump-max and
    --skip to plugin "mpe".
  * Added option --buffer-size in plugin "datainject". The plugin is now able
    to receive data using UDP, as defined in the DVB SimulCrypt protocol.
  * SCTE 35 splice information tables can now be created from XML format.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", when options --xml and --max-tables
    were both specified, the XML structure was not properly closed.
  * Application Information Tables (AIT) were not correctly serialized.
  * In rare cases, time conversions could produce incorrect results when the
    time value was in the middle of the "non-existing hour", during the
    spring switch of daylight saving time. In practice, the problem occured on
    Linux when handling the "next change time" of a TOT and the system local
    time was UTC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.10-672

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added utility "tsecmg", a DVB SimulCrypt-compliant ECMG stub to test system
    integration. The plugin "descrambler" has been enhanced to decode the
    'fake' ECM's which are generated by "tsecmg".

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The utility "tstabdump" can now dump sections and files which are sent over
    UDP/IP by "tstables" or the plugin "tables". Command line options were
    added to specify UDP parameters (same UDP reception options as input plugin
    "ip").
  * Added options --fix and --pid to plugin "continuity".
  * Added option --after-packets to plugin "filter".
  * Added options --default-interface to input plugin "ip" and plugin
    "mpeinject".
  * Added options --inter-time, --max-insert-count, --min-pts, --max-pts and
    --pts-pid to plugin "mux".
  * Added option --milli-seconds to plugin "history".
  * Input plugin "file" can now read more than one file. Input files are
    concatenated as input stream.
  * Added option --fifo-size to output plugin "dektec".
  * Added option --atis-idsa to plugins "scrambler" and "descrambler" (perform
    ATIS-IDSA scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2).
  * Added option --integer to tsversion (useful to check a version in a script).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Incorrect behaviour on Linux and macOS when receiving multicast with
    plugins "ip" and "mpeinject" and a --local-interface was specified.
  * The command "tsanalyze" and a few plugins could crash when a video PID
    contained corrupted AVC/H.264 video (or incorrect video data which looked
    like H.264).
  * Plugin "analyze" with option --interval incorrectly used the TS clock to
    produce the analysis files instead of the wall clock time.
  * Plugin "history": Detection of scrambling transitions: Now ignore packets
    without payload or with short payloads (less than 8 bytes). These packets
    are normally left clear in a scrambled PID. Considering them as clear
    packets used to report spurious scrambled-to-clear transitions, immediately
    followed by clear-to-scrambled transistions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.9-619

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Precompiled binaries are now provided for Raspbian on Raspberry Pi.
  * Added plugins "mpe" and "mpeinject" to respectively extract and inject MPE
    (Multi-Protocol Encapsulation) datagrams to/from UDP/IP. A complete example
    is provided in the user's guide.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --add-start-stuffing and --add-stop-stuffing to "tsp".
  * Added options --sei-avc and --uuid-sei to plugin "pes".
  * Added options --add-programinfo-id, --set-stream-identifier, --set-cue-type
    and --set-data-broadcast-id to plugin "pmt".
  * Added option --identify to plugin "t2mi".
  * Added options --all-once, --pack-all-sections and --pack-and-flush to
    "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added option --default-charset to "tsanalyze" and plugin "analyze".
  * Added signalization for data broadcast and MPE.
  * Improved display of Dektec devices capabilities.
  * In all TSDuck commands, parameters can be read from a file using the syntax
    "@filename" anywhere in the command line. See the user's guide for details.
  * Added possibility to specify a GitHub authentication token in "tsversion"
    to avoid "API rate limit exceeded" errors.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", when all sections were collected (option
    --all), the sections were not properly saved in binary section files
    (option --binary).
  * On Windows, the command "tsversion --upgrade" failed because tsversion.exe
    and tsduck.dll were locked by upgrade command.
  * On Linux: With DVB-T tuners which do not support "auto bandwidth"
    (PCTV 492e for instance), "tscan" failed to scan the UHF band.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.8-534

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --source and --first-source to input plugin "ip".
  * Added option --periodic-bitrate to plugin "bitrate_monitor".
  * Added options --pid, --csv and --log to plugin "pcrextract".
  * Added XML support for more DVB and EACEM descriptors.
  * When the output plugin "play" uses VLC, the player exits automatically at
    the end of the video playout.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * On macOS, the output plugin "play" now correctly detects VLC in its
    original installation path.
  * In the compilation of XML tables, when DVB strings were encoded with
    a character set different from ISO-6937 (the default character set), the
    table code was not correctly inserted at the beginning of the string.
  * In plugin "bitrate_monitor". The message was incorrect when the bitrate
    is greater then the limit (the message was ok in other cases).
  * In plugin "rmsplice", with option --adjust time, the time stamps were
    not correctly adjusted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.7-512

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "teletext" to extract Teletext subtitles in SRT format.
  * Added plugin "rmsplice" to remove ads insertions when signaled using
    SCTE 35 splice information.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --add-ca-descriptor to plugin "pmt".
  * More details are displayed in SCTE 35 splice information.
  * The command "tsp --list" is now paged, like option --help.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", with XML output, option --time-stamp
    was ineffective and option --packet-index was always on.
  * In plugin "pcrextract", options --pts and --dts were reversed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.6-491

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added the utility "tsversion" to manage TSDuck versions, detect new
    versions, upgrade, etc.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --synchronous-log and --log-message-count to "tsp". They
    affect the way log messages are dropped or displayed in case a vast amount
    of log messages are produced in a short period of time.
  * Added option --plp to "tsscan" and plugin "dvb". Used to select the DVB-T2
    PLP. This option is unsupported on Windows.
  * Added options --output-file, --append and --keep to plugin "t2mi".
  * Added HEVC signalization.
  * Added SCTE 35 signalization (splice information for ads insertion).
  * The help text of all TSDuck applications (using option --help) is now paged
    through "less" or any any other pager application.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In input plugin "ip", when multiple multicast streams are sent to the same
    UDP port (although with different addresses), make sure we receive only the
    requested stream. Previously, in some system configurations, the input
    plugin "ip" could receive packets from distinct multicast streams.
  * Various fixes about UDP on macOS: multicast reception, --reuse-port option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.5-414

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --xml-output to "tstables" and plugin "tables". Tables can be
    saved directly in XML format. It is no longer necessary to save in binary
    and then use the decompiler to rebuild XML files.
  * With "tstables" and plugin "tables", it is possible to specify several
    formats at the same time. For instance, it is possible to save tables in
    text, XML and binary format at the same time.
  * With "tspacketize" and plugin "inject", it is now possible to load tables
    in XML format. The options --binary and --xml have been added to specify
    the file type if its name is neither .bin nor .xml. It is no longer
    necessary to use the compiler to rebuild binary section files.
  * Added option --byte to "tsftrunc".
  * The options --verbose and --debug have been generalized to all commands.
  * For programmers, the TSDuck library API was extensively modified. Usage
    of 8-bit strings (char* and std::string) has been removed and replaced by
    Java-like Unicode strings (ts::UString). Many interface have been updated.
    The utilities in tsStringUtils have been removed. Equivalent services exist
    in class ts::UString. All of this break the backward compatibility of user
    code. This is unfortunate but TSDuck code is now more robust and faster to
    maintain.
  * The "revision" number is no longer a "build date" but a "commit count".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.4-20171110

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added "t2mi" plugin to extract encapsulated TS packets from T2-MI streams
    (DVB-T2 Modulator Interface).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * TSDuck now fully handles DVB character sets in signalization. All textual
    display ("tsanalyze", "tstables", etc.) are produced in UTF-8 format, with
    characters properly translated from DVB character encoding. The table
    compiler, "tstabcomp", properly translates from UTF-8 XML files to DVB
    character encoding and vice versa.
  * Added options --default-charset and --europe to "tspsi", "tstables",
    "tstabdump", "tstabcomp", plugins "psi" and "tables".
  * T2-MI PID's and PLP's are now included in the report from "tsanalyze" and
    plugin "analyze".
  * Added --test option to "tslsdvb" on Windows.
  * Improved robustness of DVB tuner detection on Windows. It solves some
    issues with 32-bit tuner filters on 64-bit systems. But older systems,
    before Windows 7 (XP, Vista, etc.), may no longer work. No further support
    will be provided for pre-7 Windows systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.3-20170930

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Removed command "tsgentab" and associated plugins. This command is now
    obsolete and has been superseded by the more general "tstabcomp", the
    PSI/SI table compiler.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --interval to plugin "count".
  * Added option --default-pds to "tspsi", "tstables", "tstabdump", plugins
    "psi" and "tables".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed timer issues on Linux, typically seen in plugin "regulate".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.3-20170915

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tstabcomp", the PSI/SI table compiler from/to XML files.
    The command tsgentab is now deprecated and will be removed in some
    future version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.2-20170911

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --pid to plugin descrambler.
  * Improved robustness of option --poll-file in plugin "inject". Mitigate
    possible race conditions when the plugin tries to open a section file
    while it is created/copied by the user. Now retry later.
  * Improved robustness of DVB tuner reception on Windows. Explicitly
    resynchronizes on valid packets when the driver misses data.
  * Adjusted output of "tslsdvb" on Windows to better identify tuner names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.2-20170528

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --poll-file to plugin "inject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", the option --max-tables was not accurate
    when several small tables (eg. EMM's) were packed in the same TS packet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.2-20170525

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added the development environment in the Windows Installer. This is used to
    develop third-party applications using the TSDuck library. On Ubuntu, added
    the tsduck-dev package. On RPM-based distros, the tsduck-devel package
    already existed.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --no-duplicate to "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added TSPLUGINS_PATH environment variable to use "tsp" plugins outside the
    directory of the TSDuck executables.

TSDUCK CHANGE LOG AND RELEASE NOTES

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.43-4440 (September 2025)

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * With  "tsp", in real-time mode, the default values are now set to 7 packets
    for  options  --max-input-packets  and  --max-flushed-packets. This is more
    consistent with UDP/IP and streaming modes.
  * Enhanced and custom identification of sources in plugin "influx".
  * In  plugin  "influx",  TR 101 290 error counters are now also available per
    PID or per service.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --summary in plugin "mpe".
    - Option --tag in plugin "influx".
    - Options --yaml, --no-yaml-header in "tsxml" (experimental).
    - Option --ignore-pid-conflict in plugin "spliceinject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * With plugin "mpe",  with  option  --log  but  without  --dump-datagram  and
    --dump-udp,  the content of the extracted datagram was displayed instead of
    the expected one-line description of the datagram.
  * Fixed issue #1667:  In plugin "spliceinject", PID conflicts between the new
    splice  information PID and existing input PID's were not detected. Now, an
    an  error is generated, unless the new option --ignore-pid-conflict is set.
  * Fixed issue #1668:  In  plugin "pat", when a new input PAT with a new TS id
    was  found,  two occurrences of the PAT were passed, one with the old TS id
    and  one  with  the new TS id. The same problem existed with SDT Actual and
    NIT Actual. The plugins "sdt" and "nit" were fixed accordingly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.42-4421 (August 2025)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "influx": Send live TS metrics to InfluxDB, a data source  for
    Grafana and other analytics applications.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * With "tstables" and plugin "tables", the option --multiple-files  now  also
    applies to XML and JSON files. Previously, it applied to binary files only.
  * Satellite reception: added support for DiSEqC 1.1 and Unicable on Linux.
  * Added secure control input. Replaced insecure TCP or UDP ports  to  control
    "tsp", "tsswitch" and others with TLS-protected Web API with authentication
    token.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --tag in plugins "history", "splicemonitor".
    - Option --pcr-based, --timestamp-based in plugin "until".
    - Options  --bytes,  --milli-seconds,   --null-sequence-count,   --packets,
      --pcr-based, --timestamp-based, --seconds, --unit-start-count  in  plugin
      "skip". The previous parameter is  replaced  with  option  --packets  but
      still accepted for compatibility.
    - Option --ffplay in output plugin "play".
    - Options --multiple and  --restart-delay  in  input  plugin  "srt".  These
      options already existed in the corresponding output plugin.
    - Option --unicable in "tsscan" and input plugin "dvb".
    - Options   --remote-tls,   --remote-certificate-path,   --remote-key-path,
      --remote-store, --remote-token in "tsswitch".
    - Options --control, --control-tls, --control-certificate-path,  --control-
      key-path, --control-store, --control-token in "tsp".  Options  --control-
      local and --control-port are now legacy and superseded by --control.
    - Options --tls, --insecure, --token in "tspcontrol".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #1637: Encryption using CTR mode incorrectly  failed  when  the
    plain text size was not a multiple of the block size. The typical use  case
    is the non-standard AES-CTR TS scrambling on 184-byte packet payload.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.41-4299 (May 2025)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "identify": Identify PID's based on various criteria.
  * Added plugin "splicerestamp": Restamp PTS in SCTE 35 splice information.
  * Added plugin "pcrduplicate": Duplicate PCR values from a  PID  into  a  new
    PCR-only PID

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * When encoding DVB strings, try all supported DVB character sets  until  one
    can encode the string. Previously, without --default-charset  option,  only
    ISO-6937, ISO-8859-15, and UTF-8 were used in the encoding process.
  * Added missing ATSC and ISDB tables and descriptors.
  * Added optional expansion of  environment  variables  in  XML  patch  files.
    Combined with the plugin "identify" which  defines  environement  variables
    with PID values which were just identified, this opens the  possibility  to
    define XML patch files without knowing precise PID values in advance.
  * Added handling of Astra-defined way of handling logical channel numbers.
  * When "less" is used as output pager command, the option -S is  added.  This
    is convenient for wide output.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --no-link-local in "tsdump", "tstabdump" and plugins "ip" (input),
      "cutoff", "mpeinject".
    - Options --summary, --epg-dump, --detailed, --width in plugin "eit".
    - Options --expand-environment, --expand-patch-xml in "tsxml".
    - Option --expand-patch-xml in plugins "bat, "cat",  "nit",  "pat",  "pmt",
      "sdt", "sections".
    - Options --default-pds, --default-registration in "tstabcomp". Useful when
      decompiling binary tables with missing PDS descriptors.
    - Option --fix-missing-pds  in  "tsp",  "tstabcomp",  plugins  "eitinject",
      "inject".
    - Options --dump-psi-repository,  --list-dvb-charset-order,  --list-tables,
      --list-descriptors in "tstables".
    - Option --remove-with-registration in plugin "pmt".
    - Options --label, --pcr-label, --drop-initial in plugin "encap".
    - Option --mute-errors in plugin "decap".
    - Option --original-network-id in plugin "nit".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #1590: In the case of corrupted streams containing inconsistent
    standards, some descriptors where not correctly interpreted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.40-4165 (Feb 2025)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "isdbinfo": Extract ISDB-T information from the stream.
  * For third-party application developers, the TSDuck library has  been  split
    into TSCore and TSDuck. The former is a subset for applications  not  using
    Digital TV features. See the developer's guide for more details.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In "tsfclean",  the audio of each service now starts at or after the PTS of
    the first intra-frame of the video of that service.
  * Added support for DSM-CC signalization and data.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --dvb in all commands and plugins where options --atsc, --isdb and
      similar options on regional standards were defined.
    - Option --only-pid in the plugin "scrambler".
    - Option --tscore in "tsconfig".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #1560:  The "srt" output plugin with  option  --multiple  could
    loop and/or fail after a client disconnection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.39-3956 (Nov 2024)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "trace": Trace packets with a custom message.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * All known and documented tables and descriptors from MPEG, DVB, ATSC, SCTE,
    and ISDB, are implemented in TSDuck. Up to the previous version, there were
    still  some  unimplemented  rare  MPEG  descriptors and ISDB tables. DSM-CC
    are not yet implemented.
  * In  plugin  "dvb"  with DVB-S2 modulation, the default PLS mode is now GOLD
    instead  of ROOT.  The GOLD mode is the one which is defined by ETSI EN 302
    307-1.  The  PLS mode COMBO has been removed. This mode does not officially
    exist.
  * In  "tsscan",  the option --delivery-system can be specified more than once
    to scan networks with more than one system, e.g. DVB-T and DVB-T2.
  * In a XML  file  which  describes a tuner emulator, the following attributes
    can  now  be specified per channel:  polarization, modulation, symbol_rate,
    and FEC_inner.
  * In "tsscan" and plugin "nitscan",  when scanning a DVB-C network, the DVB-C
    Annex  A,  B,  or  C,  which  was  used  to scan the TS carrying the NIT is
    propagated  to  scanned  TS  (issue #1518). With the plugin "nitscan", this
    is effective only if the input plugin is "dvb".
  * In  "tspcap"  and  plugin  "pcap", explore all nested levels of VLAN to get
    inner IPv4 packets (issue #1529).
  * Added  conditions  in  XML  patch files (see special attributes "x-define",
    "x-undefine", and "x-condition").
  * In  XML  files containing tables, it is possible to specify one "attribute"
    string  per  table.  This  generic  string  is passed to applications which
    may want to use it.
  * In  plugin  "eitinject",  it  is now possible to delete events from the EPG
    and  remove  them  from  EIT's before they occur. Use attribute="delete" in
    XML files to delete events instead of adding them.
  * When  reading  RS204  files (TS packets with 16-byte trailers), the trailer
    is  no  longer  discarded. It is kept all along the plugin chain, it can be
    manipulated  by  plugins and is written back if the output format is set as
    RS204.  The  following  plugins  provide  support  for  204-bytes  packets:
    "craft",  "dump",  "file",  "fork",  "ip",  "merge", "pcap", "srt", "rist".
    With "tsdump" and plugin  "dump", the option --rs204 dumps the trailer and,
    with option --isdb, the ISDB-T information is formatted. In "tsanalyze" and
    plugin  "analyze", the ISDB-T layer information is displayed by service and
    PID.
  * The  plugin  "history"  now  reports  the first and last intra-frame in all
    video PID's. With option --intra-frame, all intra-frames are reported.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --except-label in all packet processing plugins.
    - Option  --udp-format  in "tstables" and plugin "tables" to send tables in
      JSON or XML format through UDP (previously, it was binary only).
    - Option --ip-udp in "tsdump", with all usual UDP reception options.
    - Option --vlan-id in "tspcap" and input plugin "pcap".
    - Option --region-names in "tsterinfo".
    - Options --event-offset and --input-event-offset in plugin "eitinject".
    - Options --once, --synchronous, --copy, --destination in plugin "trigger".
    - Options --abnt, --atsc, --brazil, --ignore-leap-seconds, --isdb, --japan,
      --philippines, --rs204, --usa in "tsdump" and plugin "dump".
    - Option --isdb_layer in plugin "filter".
    - Option --intra-frame in plugin "history".
    - Options --rs204 and --delete-rs204 in packet processing plugin "craft".
    - Option  --rs204 in input and output plugins "craft", "ip", "pcap", "srt",
      "rist".
    - Option --display-interval, --evaluation-interval, --timestamp-priority in
      input plugin "rist". Removed option --timestamp-priority.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed  a  regression  in "tstabcomp", when an input file name was specified
    but no output file name (e.g. "tstabcomp file.xml"), the output was sent to
    the standard output instead of the default output file name (eg. file.bin).
  * Fixed issue #1519: incorrect value of program_splice_flag in SCTE 35 splice
    information tables.
  * Fixed issue #1520: assertion failure in "tscmp" in rare cases.
  * Fixed issue #1537: options --usa failed to translate to ATSC and HF band.
  * The plugin "merge" failed to receive TS packets not in 188-byte format.
  * In  "tspcap"  and  plugin  "pcap", IPv4 packets with header checksum set to
    zero  were  rejected.  Some  IP implementations do not compute the checksum
    and leave it to zero, meaning don't check.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.38-3822 (Aug 2024)

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The  documentation  has  been  reorganized  and  is now built from asciidoc
    format.  The  user guide is now installed in HTML format. A new developer's
    guide  is  also available in HTML format and installed with the development
    environment. The PDF versions are available online.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --pid in plugin "eitinject".
    - Option --joint-termination in plugin "tables".
    - Options  --json-buffer-size,  --json-interval,  --json-line,  --json-tcp,
     --json-tcp-keep, --json-udp,  --json-udp-local,  --json-udp-ttl  to  input
     plugin "dvb".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In  plugin  "eitinject", fixed duplicated events when an event was reloaded
    with same id but different content.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.37-3670 (Mar 2024)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added "tsfuzz" and plugin "fuzz": introduce random corruptions in transport
    streams. Can be used to run fuzzing attacks on receivers or TSDuck itself.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Standard  crypto  operations  (AES, DES, SHA) are now delegated to a system
    library,  OpenSSL  on  Unix, BCrypt on Windows. Previously, TSDuck included
    old  code  from  LibTomCrypt. Using a system-provided library increases the
    probability  to  take  advantage  of accelerated instruction on the current
    platform.
  * TSDuck  is  now  supported  on 64-bit RISC-V, 64-bit PowerPC, and IBM s390x
    (big endian). On s390x, use clang (gcc has a code generation bug).
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Options --meta-sections, --time-stamp in plugin "splicemonitor".
    - Option --meta-sections in "tstables", plugin "tables".
    - Option --clear-period in plugin "scrambler".
    - Option --plp0-tsrate in output plugin "dektec".
    - Option --input-timestamp in plugin "pcrextract".
    - Option --ignore-rist-timestamps in input plugin "rist".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #1389: Because of a recent regression, the plugin "mpe" crashed
    when analyzing its command line options.
  * PR #1397:  In  plugin "eitinject", events still running were discarded from
    EIT schedule when they started in a previous segment.
  * Fixed  issue  #1398:  A  corrupted sync byte in a TS packet caused "tsp" to
    loop forever.
  * Fixed issue #1400: A corrupted PES packet crashed plugin "teletext".
  * Fixed issue #1401: A corrupted PES packet crashed plugin "pes".
  * Fixed issues  #1405  and  #1407:  A  corrupted  HEVC sequence caused memory
    allocation failures in various tools and plugins ("analyze", "pes", etc.)
  * Fixed issue #1416: Using plugin "pcrcopy"  without  --reference-label, when
    label 0 was set by prevous plugins,  the reference PID could be incorrectly
    switched.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.36-3528 (Dec 2023)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added output plugin "http", acting as a server.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * TSDuck  now  requires C++17. Building TSDuck consequently requires at least
    GCC 11, LLVM / clang 5 or Visual Studio 2017 15.8.
  * Improved the precision of plugin "regulate" when based on bitrate.
  * Improved the measurement precision in plugin "bitrate_monitor".
  * Renamed  FlexMux-related  descriptors  and  fields  as M4Mux to comply with
    ISO/IEC 13818-1 9th edition.
  * Added support for many new descriptors (contribution from Paul Higgs).
  * In  "tsanalyze"  and  plugin "analyze", the LCN and hidden flag of services
    are now reported in all formats, text, normalized, JSON.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Options --json-line, --summary in plugin "bitrate_monitor".
    - Option --buffer-size in output and packet processing plugin "ip" (already
      existed in input plugin "ip" but was missing in the two others).
    - Option --random in plugin "pcredit".
    - Options  --actual-pf,  --actual-schedule,  --other-pf,  --other-schedule,
      --no-actual-pf,  --no-actual-schedule,  --other-pf,  --other-schedule  in
      command in "set" command of "tseit".
    - Options  --actual-pf,  --actual-schedule, --other-pf, --other-schedule in
      "tspacketize", "tstabcomp", plugins "inject", "eitinject".
    - Option --flush-last-unbounded-pes in plugin "pes".
    - Option --http to input plugin "pcap'.
    - Option --output-tcp-stream to "tspcap".
    - Options --compressed, --headers in input plugins "http" and "hls".
    - Option --nostdcpp in "tsconfig".
    - Option --t2mi-file in plugin "t2mi".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In  "srt"  plugins,  in  --listener mode, after a first caller successfully
    connects,  any  other  attempt to connect is properly rejected. Previously,
    due  to  an  artefact  in the SRT library, the second caller appeared to be
    connected  but  the  packets  were dropped. The third and next callers were
    properly rejected.
  * Fixed issue #996: Restarting plugin "tables" failed with JSON output.
  * Fixed issue  #1293:  In  plugin  "zap",  the  options  --subtitles-pid  and
    --audio-pid were broken and no longer selected the specified PID's.
  * In  "fork"  packet  processing  plugin,  in  option --buffered-packets, the
    value zero (no buffering at all) was not allowed.
  * Fixed issue #1321:  In input plugin "dektec", read what is available in the
    input FIFO only, instead of trying to fill the complete buffer.
  * Fixed issue #1334:  Incorrect  service  type names in JSON report of plugin
    "analyze" and "tsanalyze".
  * Fixed issue #1340:  Restarting  plugin "tables" with option --psi-si failed
    with to collect PMT's again.
  * Fixed issue #1369:  Incorrect  display  in  rare  cases  of  HEVC  sequence
    parameter set.
  * Fixed issue #1377:  Incorrect  display of stream types (PMT) in the context
    of HDMV streams (BluRay disks).
  * Fixed issue #1383:  Plugin  "history"  always failed with input plugin "ip"
    because it was not possible to determine the initial bitrate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.35-3258 (Aug 2023)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "dump" to dump TS packets (similar to command "tsdump").
  * Added packet processing "ip" (similar to output plugin "ip").
  * Added  experimental  plugin  "feed"  to  extract  an encapsulated transport
    stream from a feed.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Improvements in syntax of XML patch files:
    - Match  elements  with  an attribute value being different from something.
      Example: <PAT transport_stream_id="!1">
    - Delete a higher-level parent on a structure match.
      Example: <PMT> <component stream_type="0x06" x-node="delete(PMT)"/>
  * In plugins "spliceinject", "scrambler", "descrambler",  if the service name
    is an empty string or "-", the first service in the PAT is used.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --adaptation-field in "tsdump".
    - Option --support in "tsversion".
    - Unix: Option --disable-multicast-loop in output plugin "ip".
    - Windows:  Option  --disable-multicast-loop  in  "tstabdump", input plugin
      "ip", plugins "cutoff" and "mpeinject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issues #1203 and #1205:  On Arm64 Linux system with CPU below Armv8.2
    (typical  example:  Raspberry  Pi 4), all executables crashed with "illegal
    instruction" error.
  * Fixed issue #1219:  On  Windows, tuning to a DVB-S tuner without specifying
    the modulation (QPKS by default), crashed "tsp" and "tsscan".
  * Fixed issue #1227:  When  garbage  input  was  interpreted as a DVB service
    prominence descriptor, an infinite loop could occur.
  * Fixed issue #1234: Option --linger did not work with plugins "srt".
  * In  "dektec"  input  and  output  plugins,  several  options and modes were
    defined  but  did  not  support MPEG-TS format. Trying to use them resulted
    in  various  errors from the Dektec library. All these options were removed
    (tracked in issue #550).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.34-3197 (May 2023)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added  command  "tslatencymonitor" to monitor the latency between two input
    sources (code contribution from Amos Cheung).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * On  Arm64  platforms,  Linux  and  macOS,  improved  performances  on  data
    serialization,  CRC32 for all MPEG sections, AES, SHA-1, SHA-256  (when the
    corresponding accelerated instructions are available).
  * Using  "-P tables --log", without "--output", the logged lines are reported
    through the general logger of "tsp" instead of being output to stdout.
  * The  plugin "pes", with option --trace-packets, detects and reports invalid
    PES packets (e.g. truncated).
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --no-deep-duplicate in "tstables" and plugin "tables".
    - Option --accelerated in "tscrc32".
    - Option --ignore-crc32 in "tstabdump".
    - Option --patch-xml and --section-number in plugin "sections".
    - Options --lazy-schedule-update, --synchronous-versions in plugin
      "eitinject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In  plugin  "eitinject",  when  a  event was 64 days or more in the future,
    invalid  EIT  schedule  sections  were  generated.  Now,  these  events are
    discarded (an EPG can be only 64 days deep).
  * Fixed issue #1191:  Incorrect  display  of some HEVC sequence parameter set
    analysis in plugin "pes".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.33-3139 (Jan 2023)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tscrc32" to manually compute CRC32 as used in MPEG sections.
  * Added command "tstestecmg" to create an artificial load on an ECMG.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Ported TSDuck to FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - The  packet  processing  plugin  "file"  now  supports all options of the
      output plugin "file".
    - Option --max-files in output and packet processing plugin "file".
    - Option --set-label on plugin 'svresync".
    - Options  --custom-tag,  --live-extra-segments,  --slice-only  in   output
      plugin "hls".
    - Options --log-message-count, --synchronous-log, --timed-log to "tsecmg".
    - Option --cumulative in plugin "analyze".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * When  an  invalid / truncated  section  had  a  very large declared length,
    intermediate valid sections were ignored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.32-2983 (Oct 2022)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added  command  "tsvatek"  and  output  plugin "vatek" to handle modulators
    based on VATek chips.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In  "mpeinject"  plugin,  it is now possible to multiplex several input UDP
    stream into one single output MPE PID.
  * Added  support  for  VVC, EVC, LCEVC, AVS3 and other new codecs descriptors
    (code contribution from Paul Higgs).
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Options  --alt-group-id,  --alt-language, --alt-name, --alt-type in input
      plugin "hls".
    - Options --merge, --attributes-merge, --sort, --uncomment in "tsxml".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #1070:  In  the  plugin  "scrambler", do not fail at startup if
    the  bitrate  is  not  immediately known. Simply wait for the bitrate to be
    known before scheduling crypto-periods and ECM's.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.31-2761 (Jun 2022)

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In "dektec" output plugin, option "--input-modulation" now handles DVB-T2.
  * Added  environment  variable  TSPLUGINS_STACK_SIZE  to  specify non-default
    stack size for "tsp" plugin threads.
  * In  plugin  "sections",   the   options   --tid-remove,   --tid-ext-remove,
    --etid-remove,  --version-remove  were  renamed  without  -remove suffix to
    highlight the fact that they can be used to remove or keep sections.
  * The  plugin  "bitrate_monitor"  now  reports  the net bitrate (without null
    packets) in addition to the global bitrate.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Options --no-bitrate, --align-first-segment in output plugin "hls".
    - Options  --json-udp,  --json-tcp,  --json-buffer-size,   --json-tcp-keep,

      "sections", "tables".
    - Option --keep in plugin "sections".
    - Option --udp-end-wait in "tsemmg".
    - Option --invalid-versions in "tstables" and plugin "tables".
    - Options --byte-offset, --packet-offset in "tsdump".
    - Options --search-reorder, --min-reorder in "tscmp".
    - Option --rs204 in output plugin "ip".
    - Option --json-line in plugin "continuity".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #959:  In  the  plugin  "merge",  the  merged  EIT  PID was not
    correctly rebuilt when the merged stream contained EIT's.
  * Fixed issue #991:  In TS analysis, when an audio, subtitles or teletext PID
    had multiple languages, only the first one was reported in the analysis.
  * Fixed issue #1010: The input plugins "http" and "hls" left obsolete cookies
    files in /tmp on Linux and macOS.
  * In  "tscmp"  with option "--subset", failed to report the last hole when it
    extended up to the end of the primary file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.30-2710 (Mar 2022)

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The  bitrate  evaluation  has  been  modified in the plugin "analyze". When
    there  is  no  hardware-based  ("dvb",  "dektec")  or  clock-based   ("ip")
    evaluation  of  the  bitrate,  all  bitrate  computations  are based on the
    average bitrate, all over the capture, based on PCR's. Previously, the base
    was  the  current  "tsp"  bitrate, ie. a PCR-based evaluation from the last
    part of the stream only.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --event in output plugin "hls".
    - Option --extract-tcp-stream in "tspcap".
    - Options --carrier-only and --roll-off in output plugin "dektec".
    - Option --periodic-command in plugin "bitrate_monitor".
    - Option --final-wait in "tsp".
    - Option --user-agent in input plugins "hls", "http".
    - Option --json-line in input and output plugins "srt".
    - Option --select-commands in plugin "splicemonitor".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed bash completion incorrect behavior after plugin option (-I, -P, -O).
  * Fixed  spurious new lines on standard output in plugin "splicemonitor" with
    options --display-commands and --json.
  * Fixed issue #906:  In  output  plugin  "hls", live playlists were marked as
    event playlist.
  * In "tsscan", the handling of --min-strength was broken.
  * Fixed  a  segmentation  fault  crash in various plugins ("svremove", "sdt",
    "nit",  etc).  The crash occured when a table which is transparently passed
    in  a  modified  PID  changes  its version. For instance, if the SDT Actual
    needs  to  be  modified,  all  SDT  Other in the same PID are transparently
    passed. If one of these SDT Other changed its version, "tsp" crashed.
  * Fixed issue #939: On Windows, opening TS files with non-ASCII name failed.
  * Fixed issue #945:  In  plugin "rmorphan", the predefined ISDB or ATSC PID's
    were considered as orphan, even with --isdb or --atsc options.
  * Fixed issue #948: Fixed truncated HTTP transfers when the server sends very
    small  chunks  of data (observed with Python http.server, not seen on usual
    production servers such as Apache or IIS).
  * Fixed issue #950:  Extraction  of  T2MI streams failed in case of duplicate
    packets or packets without payload in the outer transport stream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.29-2651 (Dec 2021)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tseit" (test EIT manipulation scripts).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * All  bitrate  computations  are now implemented using 64-bit floating-point
    values.  Previously,  a  fixed-point  representation  was  used. The strict
    accuracy  was  better  but  integer  overflows in intermediate computations
    occurred from time to time, leading to incorrect evaluations.
  * On  Unix  (using  libcurl),  when  an  SSL/TLS  connection  fails with a CA
    certificate  issue,  retry  with  an  updated  list of CA certificates from
    https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem.  Transient  issues  have  been  noticed with
    Let's Encrypt CA around the certification renewal periods. The updated list
    is saved in $HOME/.tscacert.pem and is updated at most once a day.
  * In  commands  "tsp"  and  "tsswitch", the alternative syntax "--input" (for
    "-I"),  "--processor"  (for  "-P")  and "--output" (for "-O") are no longer
    accepted.  They  were  rarely  used  and  created  confusion with potential
    equivalent options in plugins.
  * Bash  completion support has been added for all TSDuck commands and plugins
    (plugin names, command and plugin options, enumeration values).
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Options  --section-number,  --negate-section-number,  --invalid-sections,
      --only-invalid-sections in "tstables" and plugin "tables".
    - Options  --bufferapi,  --final-statistics  and  --statistics-interval  in
      plugin "srt". Option --messageapi is now enabled by default.
    - Options --json and --json-line in plugin "splicemonitor".
    - Option --event-user-data in "tsswitch".
    - Options --dvb-simulcrypt and --no-pager in "tspcap".
    - Options  --emmg-client-id,  --emmg-data-id, --first-date, --first-packet,
      --first-timestamp,    --last-date,    --last-packet,    --last-timestamp,
      --tcp-emmg-mux, --udp-emmg-mux in "pcap" input plugin.
    - Option --no-replicate-duplicated in "tsfixcc" and plugin "continuity".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed  incorrect  EIT  Schedule  regeneration  on  event  change  in plugin
    "eitinject".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.28-2551 (Sep 2021)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tspcap", a simple tool to analyze pcap files (Wireshark).
  * Added plugin "pcredit" (edit PCR, PTS and DTS values in various ways).
  * Added input and output plugin "rist" (Reliable Internet Stream Transport).
  * On  macOS,  all  shared objects, including plugins, are now named '.dylib',
    the standard macOS naming, instead of '.so', a Linux naming.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --install-dvb-firmware in "tsconfig".
    - Option --local-interface in plugin "srt" (input and output).
    - Options --abnt, --atsc, --isdb in "tsscan".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #791:  In  plugin  "merge",  the PCR were not correcty adjusted
    when the input PCR had a discontinuity in the future.
  * Fixed issue #830: Incorrect formatting of HEVC HRD parameters.
  * Fixed issue #830:  Incorrect  handling  of PES packets with 1 or 2 bytes in
    last TS packet.
  * Fixed issue #840:  In "tsscan", the --lnb and --satellite-number parameters
    were not correctly passed when scanning each transport.
  * Fixed issue #841: In "tsscan", when generating channel files, the frequency
    was incorrectly set to zero on satellite networks.
  * In "tsp", the global default options for plugins (--atsc, --isdb, etc) were
    not correctly passed to plugins "tables" and "psi".
  * Fixed issue #856: The plugin "psi" with JSON output failed when restarted.
  * Fixed issue #861: On Linux and macOS, when plugins start and stop processes
    (typically  "tsswitch"  with several "fork" plugins), file descriptors were
    not  properly  segmented between processes, resulting in plugins failing to
    stop.
  * With  "--initial-input-packets N --add-start-stuffing N",  "tsp"  could not
    start as long as at least one packet was received from the input plugin.
  * Fixed issue #871:  In  plugin "eitgenerator", the version number of the EIT
    sections were not correctly updated on section content change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.27-2438 (Jun 2021)

  * Added plugin "eitinject" (generate and inject EIT's inside the TS).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added support for Dektec Ethernet devices (eg. DTA-2162).
  * The plugin "zap" can now select more than one service.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --max-output-packets in "tsp".
    - Option --force-local-multicast-outgoing in output plugin "ip".
    - Options --fifo-size, --preload-fifo in input plugin "dektec".
    - Option --wait-detach in output plugin "dektec".

      plugins "dektec".
    - Options --enforce-burst, --packet-burst in output plugin "srt".
    - Options  --audio,  --codec,  --ecm,   --emm,   --intra-frame,   --psi-si,
      --service, --subtitles, --video in plugin "filter".
    - Options --restart and --restart-interval in plugin "merge".
    - Option --system-synchronous in plugin "timeref".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #764:  SCTE  35  splice  information  tables were not correctly
    deserialized when the command length field was the legacy value 0xFFF.
  * Fixed issue #771:  Multi-standard ASI Dektec devices surch as DTA-2174B did
    not work properly.
  * Fixed  a  rare  issue where "tsp" with option --add-input-stuffing silently
    terminated after some long random time.
  * Fixed issue #811: In plugin "merge", the options --drop and --pass were not
    correctly handled when they had one single value (not a range).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.26-2349 (Apr 2021)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added input and output plugins "memory" (direct application interaction).
  * Added input plugin "pcap" (Wireshark capture files).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Resource  monitoring  of  "tsp"  and  "tsswitch"  (option --monitor) is now
    configurable  using XML files and alarm commands can be triggered on CPU or
    memory misbehavior.
  * When the environment variable TSDUCK_NO_USER_CONFIG is defined to some non-
    empty value, the user's configuration file is not loaded.
  * Bitrates  are now handled, entered and computed with one decimal digit. The
    increased precision was required by some modulations.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --event-code in plugins "mpe", "psi" and "tables".
    - Options --min-bitrate and --min-inter-packet in plugin "spliceinject".
    - Option --java and --python in "tsconfig".
    - Options    --alarm-command,     --max-pre-roll-time,    --max-repetition,
      --min-pre-roll-time, --min-repetition value and --no-adjustment to plugin
      "splicemonitor".
    - Options  --event-command,  --event-udp,  --event-ttl  and  --event-local-
      address to "tsswitch".
    - Options --max-size and --max-duration in output plugin "file".
    - Options --multiple and --restart-delay in output plugin "srt".
    - Options  --caller  and  --listener in "srt" input and output plugins. The
      address:port parameter and the --rendezvous options are now legacy.
    - Option  --ignore-leap-seconds  in  "tsanalyze", "tsdate", "tsp", "tspsi",
      "tstabcomp",  "tstabdump",  "tstables"  and  plugins  "analyze",   "psi",
      "tables".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In  the  display of SCTE 35 splice information tables, the UTC times in the
    splice_schedule() commands were incorrectly displayed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.25-2237 (Feb 2021)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "splicemonitor" (monitor SCTE-35 splice commands).
  * Added input and output plugins "memory" for C++/Java/Python developers.
  * Java  bindings  have  been  added  for  high-level  functions of the TSDuck
    library. All "tsp" features are now available from Java.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Everywhere an input XML file name is expected, it is possible to specify an
    "inline XML content"  directly.  The  string is recognized as an inline XML
    content and not a file name when it starts with "<?xml".
  * In  most utilities or plugins where XML files can be read or written, it is
    possible  to  specify an automated XML-to-JSON conversion and read or write
    JSON input or output.
  * Everywhere  XML  or  JSON output can be produced, it is possible to log the
    XML  or  JSON data on one line using options --log-xml-line (or --xml-line)
    and  --json-line. Java or Python applications which intercept messages from
    a TSProcessor can more easily grab the complete output data.
  * HEVC video attributes are now extracted and reported.
  * DVB-T/T2  and  ISDB-T  are  no longer enumeration values ("6-MHz", "8-MHz",
    etc).  They are arbitrary values in Hz. The previous values in command line
    are still accepted for compatibility.
  * In plugin "bitrate_monitor", the alarm command receives more parameters.
  * The plugin "reduce" can now reduce the bitrate using PCR and VBR.
  * The  command  "tstabcomp"  can use the standard input and output for XML or
    binary section files.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --save-es in plugin "pes".
    - Option  --extended-info  in  "tslsdvb"  (--verbose no longer displays the
      extremely verbose graph, use --extended-info for this).
    - Option  --usa  in  "tsanalyze",  "tsdate",  "tsp",   "tspsi",   "tsscan",
      "tstabcomp",  "tstabdump",  "tstables",  "tsterinfo"  and  plugins "dvb",
      "analyze", "psi", "tables".
    - Option  --abnt  in  "tsanalyze",  "tsdate",  "tsp", "tspsi", "tstabcomp",
      "tstabdump", "tstables" and plugins "analyze", "psi", "tables".
    - Options  --fixed-proportion,  --input-bitrate,  --packet-window,   --pcr-
      based,  --reference-pcr-pid,  --target-bitrate,  --time-window  in plugin
      "reduce".
    - Option  --json-line  in  "tsanalyze",  "tscmp",  "tsdektec"  and   plugin
      "analyze".
    - Options  --log-xml-line  and  --log-hexa-line  to  "tstables"  and plugin
      "tables".
    - Options  --log-xml-line,  --strict-xml,  --text-output,  --xml-output  to
      "tspsi" and plugin "psi".
    - Options --json, --json-line, --from-json and --x2j-* to "tsxml".
    - Options  --json-output,  --log-json-line,  --rewrite-json  and --x2j-* to
      "tstables" and plugin "tables".
    - Options  --json-output, --log-json-line and --x2j-* to "tspsi" and plugin
      "psi".
    - Options --json, --from-json and --x2j-* to "tstabcomp".
    - Option --json to "tspacketize".
    - Option --default-pds to "tsanalyze", "tsscan" and plugin "analyze".
    - Option --log-hexa-line to plugin "mpe".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * The  global  "tsp"  options  --default-pds  and  --hf-band-region  were not
    correctly passed to the plugins.
  * Fixed issue #719:  The option  --default-pds  was  not  correctly  used  in
    "tsscan"  when  looking for logical channel numbers in streams with invalid
    signalization (missing private data specifier descriptor).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.24-2109 (Dec 2020)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "stats" (report various statistics on PID's and labels).
  * Added command "tsxml" to test the validation and patches of XML files.
  * For  developers  who  use  the  TSDuck  library on Linux and macOS, the new
    command "tsconfig" generates the various build options for the applications
    depending on the current operating system.
  * Python  bindings  have  been  added  for high-level functions of the TSDuck
    library. All "tsp" features are now available from Python.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In  all  commands  and  plugins  which  produce "normalized" output, a JSON
    output  format  has  been  added.  The  traditional "normalized" format was
    designed  for  use  with  "grep" and "sed" and dates back from a time where
    JSON did not exist.
  * In all commands and plugins which define the option --format (file format),
    the  new value "RS204" designates TS files containing 204-byte packets with
    trailing Reed-Solomon code.
  * In plugin "pcrextract" the default CSV separator is now "," instead of ";".
  * Added "default.time" to configuration file (see option --time-reference).
  * General improvement of ISDB support for Brazil and the Philippines:
    - Default character set, time reference and HF bands.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --log-plugin-index in "tsp".
    - Option --subtitles-pid in plugin "zap".
    - Option --json in "tscmp" and "tsdektec".
    - Options --json and --deterministic in "tsanalyze" and plugin "analyze".
    - Options --save-pes, --intra-image, --h26x-default-format in plugin "pes".
    - Options --intra-close and --max-extra-duration to output plugin "hls".
    - Options  --bitrate,  --acceleration-threshold, --incremental-pcr-restamp,
      --no-smoothing, --pcr-reset-backwards in plugin "merge".
    - Options --atsc, --isdb, --japan to "tsdate".
    - Options  --brazil,  --philippines  and  --time-reference  in "tsanalyze",
      "tsdate",  "tsp",  "tspsi",  "tstabcomp",  "tstabdump",  "tstables"   and
      plugins "analyze", "psi", "tables".
    - Options  --and,  --tid-ext-remove,  --version-remove,  --reverse-etid  in
      plugin "sections".
    - Options --add-start-stuffing and --add-stop-stuffing in plugin "file".
    - Option --patch-xml to plugins "bat", "cat", "nit", "pat", "pmt", "sdt".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #646:  Several  commands and plugins crashed in case of invalid
    PES  packets  when the specified PES length was not zero but lower than the
    PES header size.
  * Fixed issue #651:  When fixing the PCR's in the "merge" plugin, there was a
    slow drift on merged PCR values after several hours.
  * Fixed issue #653:  When serializing NIT, SDT and BAT, the maximum size of a
    section  was  4096  bytes  as  for  all private sections (non-MPEG) but DVB
    specifies  that these three specific tables shall not exceed 1024 bytes per
    section.
  * Fixed issue #664:  Due  to a probably long-standing regression, the command
    "tsterinfo" was no longer able to guess modulation parameters from bitrate.
  * Fixed issue in "tsp": When Ctr-C was in the startup phase (before the first
    packets were received), "tsp" hanged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.23-1965 (Sep 2020)

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * At most once a day, the "tsp" command interrogates GitHub in the background
    to  check  the  availability  of  a  new  release  of  TSDuck.  Define  the
    environment variable TSDUCK_NO_VERSION_CHECK do disable this.
  * With  commands  and  plugins  which  access the Internet such as the "http"
    plugin,  the  environment  variables "http_proxy" and "https_proxy" are now
    used on Windows also.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #632:  When  the  input  plugin  "http" was used with --ignore-
    errors  and  either  --infinite  or  --repeat,  restarting  the plugin from
    "tspcontrol" entered an infinite loop.
  * Fixed issue #633:  In  version  3.22,  a  regression  was  introduced which
    crashed the plugin "fork" in the packet processor version ("-P fork").

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.22-1953 (Aug 2020)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * On  Linux  and  macOS,  the  installation of TSDuck files are no longer all
    inside  /usr/bin.  Shared  libraries  are  in  /usr/lib,  plugins  are   in
    /usr/lib/tsduck,  configuration  files  are in /usr/share/tsduck. On macOS,
    /usr/local  is  used  instead  of  /usr.  On  some  64-bit  Linux  distros,
    /usr/lib64 is used instead of /usr/lib.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The  "tsp" command now keeps track of input time-stamps for each packet and
    propagate  the  information  to  all  plugins  (see  improvement  in plugin
    "pcrverify").
  * Most commands reading TS files can read M2TS files as well.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --format in "tsanalyze", "tsbitrate", "tscmp", "tsdate", "tsdump",
      "tspsi",  "tstables",  plugins  "file",  "fork" (input, output and packet
      processor) and plugins "merge", "mux".
    - Options --input-format and --output-format in "tsstuff".
    - Options --input-synchronous and --jitter-unreal in plugin "pcrverify".
    - Option --timestamp-priority in input plugins "ip" and "srt".
    - Option --size-of-packet in "tsftrunc".
    - Options  --eit-normalization,  --eit-base-date  and  --pack-and-flush  in
      "tspacketize", "tstabcomp" and plugin "inject".
    - Option --pack-sections in plugin "mpeinject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #587:  Due  to an intermediate integer overflow, the report PCR
    jitters were sometimes completely incorrect.
  * Sections  of  some DVB, ATSC and ARIB tables, when serialized, were limited
    to  1024  bytes  instead  of 4096. Only MPEG-defined PSI sections should be
    limited to 1024 bytes.
  * Fixed issue #619:  "tsecmg"  failed  to process an ECM request with crypto-
    period numbers wrapping over 0xFFFF (eg. CP = 0xFFFF and 0x0000).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.21-1819 (May 2020)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added  command  "tscharset"  to perform manual string encoding and decoding
    using various DVB and ARIB character sets.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * LNB's  for  satellite  reception  are  now  preconfigured from an XML file.
    Polarization-controlled  LNB's  are  now  supported.  Added   "default.lnb"
    in global configuration file.
  * General improvement of Japanese TV support:
    - Japanese character sets as defined in ARIB STD-B24.
    - Partial ISDB signalization, as defined in ARIB STD-B10.
    - Option --japan triggers suitable defaults for Japanese TV.
  * New options in existing commands and plugins:
    - Option --initial-input-packets in "tsp".
    - Options  --reopen-on-error,  --max-retry  and  --retry-interval in output
      plugin "file".
    - Option --stream-id in "tsscan" and plugins "dvb", "filter".
    - Option  --japan  in  "tsanalyze",  "tspsi",   "tstabcomp",   "tstabdump",

      "svrename", "teletext", "zap".
    - Option --drop-to-maintain-preload in output plugin "dektec".
    - Option  --nit-scan  in  "tsscan" (UHF-band scan is no longer the default,
      exactly one of --nit-scan, --uhf-band, --vhf-band shall be specified).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed issue #515:  In  some  cases,  when  multi-section  long  tables were
    injected,  after  some  time,  sections  were  not  always  inserted in the
    increasing order of section numbers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.20-1689 (Mar 2020)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tspcontrol" to send control commands to a running "tsp".
  * Added  input  and  output plugins "srt" for Secure Reliable Transport (code
    contribution  from  Lola  Delannoy).  This  plugin  is  not compiled on all
    platforms (subject to availability of libsrt).
  * For  developers,  the  features  of  "tsp"  and  "tsswitch"  are now easily
    accessible  from  the  TSDuck  library.  See  classes  ts::TSProcessor  and
    ts::InputSwitcher.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added  option  --control-port  to "tsp" and other related --control options
    for use with the new command "tspcontrol".
  * Added option --eit-date-only to plugin "timeref".

  * Added  options  --local-time-offset,   --next-change,   --next-time-offset,
    --only-country name and --only-region to plugin "timeref".
  * The command "tsdump" now displays the splice countdown when there is one.
  * Added  options  --has-splice-countdown,  --splice-countdown,  --min-splice-
    countdown and --max-splice-countdown to plugin "filter".
  * Added option --label-close to output plugin "hls".
  * Added option --ignore-absent to plugin "zap".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In  input  plugin  "hls",  when  the  sub-playlists  or  media segments had
    relative  URI's with absolute file path, the sub-playlists or segments were
    not correctly loaded.
  * On  Unix  systems  (Linux,  macOS),  the  option --append was not correctly
    handled in plugin "file". The file was rewritten from the beginning.
  * In  plugin  "pes", when a NALunit contained more than one SEI message, only
    the first one was reported.
  * In  plugin  "spliceinject",  the  non-immediate time_signal() commands were
    immediately injected. Now, they are processed the same way as non-immediate
    splice_insert() commands.
  * In  command  "tsp",  when  the number of initial null packets (--add-start-
    stuffing)  was  larger  than half the global buffer, the command terminated
    before having read the input (an end of file was incorrectly assumed).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.19-1520 (Nov 2019)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "timeshift" (delay packet transmission).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --receive-timeout to "tsp".
  * Added  options --aes-cbc, --aes-ctr, --iv, --ctr-counter-bits, --output-cw-
    file to plugins "scrambler" and "descrambler".
  * Added option --swap-cw to plugin "descrambler".
  * Added  default  CAS  selection options --default-cas-id, --conax, --irdeto,
    --mediaguard, --nagravision, --nds, --safeaccess, --viaccess, --widevine to
    "tspsi", "tstabdump", "tstables" and plugins "psi", "tables".
  * Added option --extensions to "tsversion" and "tstabcomp".
  * Complete ATSC signalization, as defined in A/65, is now supported.
  * NorDig-private descriptors are supported.
  * Added option --power-mode to "tsdektec" and output plugin "dektec".
  * Added  options  --build-service-list-descriptors and --default-service-type
    to plugin "nit".
  * Added options --start and --stop to plugin "trigger".
  * Added option --local-port to plugins "ip" (output) and "mpe".
  * Service  id or name is now optional in plugin "svrename". When omitted, the
    default service is the first one in the PAT.
  * On  Linux,  multi-standard  tuners  are  now supported (for instance tuners
    which  support  DVB-T  and DVB-C). The options --delivery-system is used to
    select  the  appropriate  type.  Multi-standard tuners are not supported on
    Windows.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In  plugin  "hides",  the bandwidth was incorrectly set to 5 MHz when 6 MHz
    was requested.
  * In plugin "continuity", packets were incorrectly detected as duplicate when
    they had the same continuity counter but distinct content.
  * Fixed HEVC_video_descriptor to latest version of ISO 13818-1 standard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.18-1361 (Aug 2019)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added  plugin "craft" as input to build specifically crafted packets and as
    packet processor to similarly alter packets in transit.
  * Added  plugin  "trigger"  which  executes  actions  on  selected labeled TS
    packets.
  * Added plugin "cutoff" which sets labels on TS packets upon reception of UDP
    messages.
  * Added plugin "psimerge" which merges PSI/SI from mixed streams.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added  option --only-label to all packet processing plugins. There is a new
    possibility  to mark individual packets with a label which can be reused in
    other plugins.
  * Added  options  --label, --set-label, --reset-label, --set-permanent-label,
    --reset-permanent-label, --nullified, --input-stuffing, --every, --interval
    to plugin "filter".
  * Added  option  --atsc  to  commands   "tsanalyze",   "tstables",   "tspsi",
    "tstabdump", "tstabcomp" and plugins "analyze", "tables", "psi".
  * Added option --pes-offset to plugin "encap" (synchronous PES mode).
  * Added  options  --add-registration  and  --add-pid-registration  to  plugin
    "pmt". The option --add-programinfo-id is now deprecated.
  * Added option --eit to plugin "timeref".
  * Added option --tag to plugin "count".
  * Added  options  --single,  --set-label and --reset-label to plugins "remap"
    and "duplicate".
  * Added  options  --terminate,  --joint-termination, --set-label and --reset-
    label to plugin "merge".
  * Added options --set-label and --reset-label to plugin "mux".
  * Added  options  --set-label-below,  --set-label-normal,  --set-label-above,
    --set-label-go-below, --set-label-go-normal, --set-label-go-above to plugin
    "bitrate_monitor".
  * Added  RTP  support for output plugin "ip": added options --rtp, --payload-
    type, --pcr-pid, --ssrc-identifier and --start-sequence-number.
  * Added  options  --interleave,  --label-base  and --first-terminate to input
    plugin "file".
  * Added option --min-ms-interval to plugin "pcradjust".
  * Added  options --preload-fifo, --maintain-preload, --preload-fifo-delay and
    --preload-fifo-percentage in output plugin "dektec".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed  an  issue  while reading XML files: leading and trailing spaces were
    removed by default inside all text nodes.
  * Fixed  input  plugin  "dektec":  with  satellite receivers, the LNB was not
    properly enabled.
  * In  input  plugin "hls", the cookies which were returned by a playlist were
    not passed to the next playlist or segment download.
  * In  plugin  "regulate" with option --pcr-synchronous, the stream was passed
    unregulated after 26.5 hours (a complete PCR cycle).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.17-1189 (Apr 2019)

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In  commands  "tsanalyze",  "tsdump", "tspsi", "tstabdump", "tstables", the
    display is now sent through a pager application (less/more) when the output
    device is a terminal. Added option --no-pager to disable this.
  * In the input plugin "hls", after loading a master playlist, if the selected
    media playlist is not found, try next one, etc.
  * Added option --evaluate-pcr-offset to plugin "pcrextract".
  * Added option --dvb-cissa to plugins "scrambler" and "descrambler".
  * Added  options  --pid and --tag to plugin "bitrate_monitor". The plugin can
    now also monitor the bitrate of the complete TS and can detect zero bitrate
    on the transport stream.
  * Added option --start-media-sequence to output plugin "hls".
  * Added option --pack-and-flush to "tstabcomp".
  * In various analysis commands and plugins, ATSC signalization is now known.
  * General list of improvements regarding tuners and scanning:
    - Added  region-specific  UHF/VHF frequency layouts in various commands and
      plugins.  Added  option  --hf-band-region  to plugins "dvb", "dektec" and
      commands  "tsterinfo", "tsscan". Added option --default-region to command
      "tsterinfo".
    - The  command  "tsscan"  can  now  perform VHF band scanning: added option
      --vhf-band.  Offsets  are  no longer used by default: added option --use-
      offsets.
    - In  plugin  "dvb"  and  command  "tsscan":  Added --guard-interval values
      "1/128",  "19/128",  "19/256".  Added  --transmission-mode  values  "1K",
      "2K-interleaved",  "4K-interleaved",  "16K",  "32K".  Added  --modulation
      values  "16-APSK",  "32-APSK" (DVB-S2).  The option --channel-transponder
      now accepts ATSC channel ids (major.minor).
    - The  old  "zap" format which was inherited from some Linux scanning tools
      is  no  longer  supported by TSDuck. Instead, a more generic and portable
      XML format is used. See the user's guide for more details. Impact:
      . In  plugin  "dvb"  and  command  "tsscan":  Added option --tuning-file,
        removed options --tune and --zap-config-file.
      . In plugin "nitscan" and command "tsscan", added options --save-channels
        and --update-channels.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed support for ATSC tuners on Windows.
  * In  plugin  "scrambler",  fixed a crypto-period issue with option --cw-file
    and more than one CW.
  * Now  accept  to demux probably incorrect section muxing when a TS packet is
    such that  1) PUSI is set,  2) start of payload before the pointer field is
    unused  (do  not  contain a valid section) and 3) starts with FF. This is a
    probably  incorrect  muxing  which has been found on at least one satellite
    transponder.
  * Fixed  bitrate computation based on PCR's. Null packets uselessly reset the
    bitrate computation and introduced a small bias. New computed values can be
    slightly different but more accurate.
  * Fixed various discrepancies in adjustment of continuity counters.
  * The  option  --default-charset was not always correctly used when compiling
    tables from XML.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.16-1110 (Jan 2019)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added input plugin "hls" to receive HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).
  * Added output plugin "hls" to generate HLS media segments and playlists.
  * Added plugin "pcradjust" to adjust PCR's according to a constant bitrate.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * In  all commands and plugins, when an option takes an integer value and can
    be  present  several  times, it is now possible to specify ranges of values
    (e.g. "--pid 0-3" instead of "--pid 0 --pid 1 --pid 2 --pid 3").
  * Added option --pack to plugin "encap".
  * Added options --log, --log-size, --no-headers and --pid to "tsdump".
  * Added option --fill-eit to "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added options for Dektec demodulators in input plugin "dektec".
  * In plugin "rmsplice", immediate splice events are no longer ignored.
  * Added  PES  encapsulation  mode in plugin "encap" (added option --pes-mode,
    added optional value in option --pack).
  * Added  option --threshold4 in plugin "limit". The packet selection strategy
    was changed.
  * Added option --enforce-burst in output plugin "ip".
  * Implement guidelines from ETSI TR 101 211 when compiling EIT's.
  * In  XML  descriptions  of  NIT  and  BAT,  it  is now possible to specify a
    preferred section index for each TS.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In plugin "http", the option --receive-timeout was ignored.
  * In  "tsanalyze"  and plugin "analyze", section analysis was missing on some
    PID's (including EIT's).
  * On  Linux  with  BusyBox  environment,  the --help options (and other paged
    commands) no longer fail due to unsupported option for less.
  * The  order  of  combining diacritical characters was incorrectly handled in
    DVB tables with the default character set.
  * In  plugin  "scrambler" with option --cw-file, there was a crash at the end
    of the first crypto-period. This was a regression.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.15-1008 (Nov 2018)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tsswitch", a TS input switcher with remote control.
  * Added command "tsgenecm", generate one ECM using any DVB SimulCrypt ECMG.
  * Added plugin "limit" to limit the global TS bitrate.
  * Added plugin "duplicate" to duplicate one or more PID's.
  * Added plugins "encap" and "decap" to encapsulate and decapsulate PID's into
    one single tunnel PID.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The  plugin "fork" can now be used as input and output plugin as well. When
    used as an input plugin (new), it reads packets from the command output.
  * Added option --ignore-errors to "tsbitrate" and plugin "pcrbitrate".
  * Added option --receive-timeout to "tstabdump" and plugins "dektec" (input),
    "ip" (input), "mpeinject".
  * Added  options  --udp-size,  --min-udp-size,  --max-udp-size,   --net-size,
    --min-net-size, --max-net-size to plugin "mpe".
  * Added option --network-id to plugin "nitscan".
  * Added option --strict-xml to "tstabcomp", "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added option --max-packets to "tsdump".
  * The command "tsdump" can now accept multiple input files.
  * Added demodulator support in the input plugin "dektec" (e.g. DTA-2137).
  * Added options --audio-pid and --eit to plugin "zap".
  * Added option --sei-type to plugin "pes".
  * Added option --event-id to plugin "rmsplice".
  * Added  the  per-user configuration file $HOME/.tsduck to specify default or
    alternate options to various commands.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In  XML  documents which were generated by TSDuck, some characters were not
    properly escaped.
  * In  "tsp",  in  case  of  output  error, when a plugin was slowing down the
    playout speed (such as "regulate"), the command was slow to terminate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.14-894 (Sep 2018)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "sections".
  * Optional rebuild without teletext support (without plugin "teletext").

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --remove-stream-type to plugin "pmt".
  * Added options --network-name, --network-id and --nit-other to plugin "nit".
  * Added option --provider to plugin "svrename".
  * Added  options  --include-next and --exclude-current to commands "tstables"
    and "tspsi" and to plugins "tables" and "psi".
  * Added  options --rewrite-binary and --rewrite-xml to command "tstables" and
    plugin "tables".
  * Added keywork "system" to option --start in plugin "timeref".
  * Added option --transparent to plugin "merge".
  * Added options --other, --ts-id, --original-network-id to plugin "sdt".
  * Added  options  --create,  --create-after,   --bitrate,  --inter-packet  to
    plugins "pat", "pmt", "bat", "sdt", "nit".
  * Added option --wide-display to command "tsanalyze" and plugin "analyze".
  * Added option --min-interval to command "tsstuff".
  * Added option --scte35 to plugin "pcrextract".
  * In plugin "inject", when all input files have specific repetition rates, it
    is no longer required to provide a bitrate for the PID. It is computed from
    the size and repetition rate of all sections.
  * Some performance improvement by removing processing which are used in debug
    or verbose mode only (options --debug and --verbose).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In  plugin "merge", merging CAT's from two streams was incorrect (incorrect
    PID conflict detection and endless code loop).
  * On  Windows, "tslsdvb" and "tshides" could crash when using a HiDes UT-100A
    (combined received / modulator).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.13-834 (Jul 2018)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added input plugin "http" to receive a transport stream using a URL.
  * Added  support  for  HiDes UT-100C modulator device using utility "tshides"
    and output plugin "hides". Be sure to install the right device drivers from
    https://tsduck.io/hides/

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * With plugins "svremove", "svrename" and "tsrename", the removal or renaming
    now also apply to EIT's. The new option --ignore-eit can be used to prevent
    this.
  * The  plugin "regulate" can now also use the PCR from the TS to regulate the
    transmission.  Previously,  the  regulation was done on bitrate only. Added
    options are --pcr-synchronous, --pid-pcr and --wait-min.
  * The  input  plugin  "ip"  and  the plugin "mpeinject" now accept the syntax
    'source-ip@multicast-ip:port'  for  source-specific  multicast (SSM).  As a
    side  effect,  the  command  "tstabdump"  also  accepts  this  syntax  when
    receiving PSI/SI tables.
  * Added option --tos to output plugin "ip".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Bug fix:  Option  --cleanup-private-descriptors  in  plugins  "bat", "cat",
    "nit", "pmt" and "sdt" failed to cleanup contiguous private descriptors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.12-781 (Jun 2018)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "merge" which merges two transport streams.
  * On  Windows,  portable  packages  are  now  built  for  users without admin
    privilege.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added  option  --realtime to "tsp". This option selects appropriate default
    options  when  operating  on  real-time  streamings. The "default defaults"
    remain  appropriate  for  offline  processing, such as working on transport
    streams  files. This option is also automatically set by some plugins which
    are  designed  for  real-time  streaming  ("dvb",  "ip", "dektec",  "play",
    "regulate", "mpeinject").
  * The  option  --reuse-port  is now on by default on all commands and plugins
    which  use  it.  A  new option --no-reuse-port has been added everywhere to
    disable the option explicitly (although probably never used).
  * Added  options  --log-protocol  and  --log-data  to  "tsecmg", "tsemmg" and
    plugins "scrambler", "datainject".
  * Added options --udp and --unregulated to plugin "datainject".
  * Many more descriptors are supported. See the user's guide.
  * In  "tsemmg",  sending UDP data to a broadcast address was not allowed. Now
    it  is  possible  to  send  data to a local broadcast address. Using routed
    broadcast remains not possible (because this is usually not a good thing to
    route broadcast).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * If  an XML representation of a splice information table contained a splice_
    insert  command, the <break_duration> structure was rejected when the event
    was marked as immediate.
  * In  "tsemmg", the TCP disconnection of the MUX was not detected in a timely
    fashion when data was injected using UDP.
  * In "tsecmg", the option --max-comp-time was ignored.
  * Regression fix:  In  plugin  "datainject",  the  section mode was no longer
    handled correctly since version 3.10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.11-716 (May 2018)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added utility "tsemmg", an EMMG simulator for MUX integration testing.
  * Added  plugin  "spliceinject"  to inject SCTE 35 splice information in real
    time.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added  options  --sync-layout,  --dump-datagram, --dump-udp, --dump-max and
    --skip to plugin "mpe".
  * Added  option  --buffer-size in plugin "datainject". The plugin is now able
    to receive data using UDP, as defined in the DVB SimulCrypt protocol.
  * SCTE 35 splice information tables can now be created from XML format.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", when options --xml and --max-tables were
    both specified, the XML structure was not properly closed.
  * Application Information Tables (AIT) were not correctly serialized.
  * In  rare  cases,  time conversions could produce incorrect results when the
    time  value was in the middle of the "non-existing hour", during the spring
    switch  of  daylight saving time. In practice, the problem occured on Linux
    when handling the "next change time" of a TOT and the system local time was
    UTC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.10-674 (Apr 2018)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added utility "tsecmg", a DVB SimulCrypt-compliant ECMG stub to test system
    integration.  The plugin "descrambler" has been enhanced to decode the fake
    ECM's which are generated by "tsecmg".

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The utility "tstabdump" can now dump sections and files which are sent over
    UDP/IP  by  "tstables"  or  the  plugin "tables". Command line options were
    added to specify UDP parameters (same UDP reception options as input plugin
    "ip").
  * Added options --fix and --pid to plugin "continuity".
  * Added option --after-packets to plugin "filter".
  * Added  options  --default-interface  to  input  plugin  "ip"   and   plugin
    "mpeinject".
  * Added  options  --inter-time,  --max-insert-count, --min-pts, --max-pts and
    --pts-pid to plugin "mux".
  * Added option --milli-seconds to plugin "history".
  * Input  plugin  "file"  can  now  read  more  than one file. Input files are
    concatenated as input stream.
  * Added option --fifo-size to output plugin "dektec".
  * Added  option --atis-idsa to plugins "scrambler" and "descrambler" (perform
    ATIS-IDSA scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2).
  * Added option --integer to tsversion, useful to check a version in a script.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Incorrect  behaviour  on  Linux  and  macOS  when  receiving multicast with
    plugins "ip" and "mpeinject" and a --local-interface was specified.
  * The  command  "tsanalyze"  and  a  few plugins could crash when a video PID
    contained  corrupted  AVC/H.264 video (or incorrect video data which looked
    like H.264).
  * Plugin  "analyze"  with  option --interval incorrectly used the TS clock to
    produce the analysis files instead of the wall clock time.
  * Plugin  "history":  Detection of scrambling transitions: Now ignore packets
    without  payload  or with short payloads (less than 8 bytes). These packets
    are  normally  left  clear  in  a  scrambled PID. Considering them as clear
    packets used to report spurious scrambled-to-clear transitions, immediately
    followed by clear-to-scrambled transistions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.9-619 (Mar 2018)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Precompiled binaries are now provided for Raspbian on Raspberry Pi.
  * Added  plugins "mpe" and "mpeinject" to respectively extract and inject MPE
    (Multi-Protocol Encapsulation) datagrams to/from UDP/IP. A complete example
    is provided in the user's guide.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --add-start-stuffing and --add-stop-stuffing to "tsp".
  * Added options --sei-avc and --uuid-sei to plugin "pes".
  * Added options --add-programinfo-id, --set-stream-identifier, --set-cue-type
    and --set-data-broadcast-id to plugin "pmt".
  * Added option --identify to plugin "t2mi".
  * Added  options  --all-once,  --pack-all-sections  and  --pack-and-flush  to
    "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added option --default-charset to "tsanalyze" and plugin "analyze".
  * Added signalization for data broadcast and MPE.
  * Improved display of Dektec devices capabilities.
  * In all TSDuck commands, parameters can be read from a file using the syntax
    "@filename" anywhere in the command line. See the user's guide for details.
  * Added  possibility  to specify a GitHub authentication token in "tsversion"
    to avoid "API rate limit exceeded" errors.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", when all sections were collected (option
    --all),  the  sections  were  not  properly  saved  in binary section files
    (option --binary).
  * On  Windows, the command "tsversion --upgrade" failed because tsversion.exe
    and tsduck.dll were locked by upgrade command.
  * On  Linux:  With  DVB-T  tuners which do not support "auto bandwidth" (PCTV
    492e for instance), "tscan" failed to scan the UHF band.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.8-534 (Feb 2018)

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --source and --first-source to input plugin "ip".
  * Added option --periodic-bitrate to plugin "bitrate_monitor".
  * Added options --pid, --csv and --log to plugin "pcrextract".
  * Added XML support for more DVB and EACEM descriptors.
  * When  the  output plugin "play" uses VLC, the player exits automatically at
    the end of the video playout.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * On  macOS,  the  output  plugin  "play"  now  correctly  detects VLC in its
    original installation path.
  * In  the  compilation  of  XML  tables, when DVB strings were encoded with a
    character  set  different  from  ISO-6937  (the default character set), the
    table code was not correctly inserted at the beginning of the string.
  * In  plugin "bitrate_monitor". The message was incorrect when the bitrate is
    greater then the limit (the message was ok in other cases).
  * In  plugin  "rmsplice", with option --adjust time, the time stamps were not
    correctly adjusted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.7-512 (Jan 2018)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "teletext" to extract Teletext subtitles in SRT format.
  * Added  plugin  "rmsplice" to remove ads insertions when signaled using SCTE
    35 splice information.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --add-ca-descriptor to plugin "pmt".
  * More details are displayed in SCTE 35 splice information.
  * The command "tsp --list" is now paged, like option --help.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", with XML output, option --time-stamp was
    ineffective and option --packet-index was always on.
  * In plugin "pcrextract", options --pts and --dts were reversed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.6-491 (Jan 2018)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added  the  utility  "tsversion"  to  manage  TSDuck  versions,  detect new
    versions, upgrade, etc.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added  options  --synchronous-log  and  --log-message-count  to "tsp". They
    affect  the way log messages are dropped or displayed in case a vast amount
    of log messages are produced in a short period of time.
  * Added  option --plp to "tsscan" and plugin "dvb". Used to select the DVB-T2
    PLP. This option is unsupported on Windows.
  * Added options --output-file, --append and --keep to plugin "t2mi".
  * Added HEVC signalization.
  * Added SCTE 35 signalization (splice information for ads insertion).
  * The help text of all TSDuck applications (using option --help) is now paged
    through "less" or any any other pager application.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In  input plugin "ip", when multiple multicast streams are sent to the same
    UDP port (although with different addresses), make sure we receive only the
    requested  stream.  Previously,  in  some  system configurations, the input
    plugin "ip" could receive packets from distinct multicast streams.
  * Various fixes about UDP on macOS: multicast reception, --reuse-port option.

VERSION 3.5-419 (Jan 2018)

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added  option --xml-output to "tstables" and plugin "tables". Tables can be
    saved  directly  in XML format. It is no longer necessary to save in binary
    and then use the decompiler to rebuild XML files.
  * With  "tstables"  and  plugin  "tables",  it is possible to specify several
    formats  at  the  same time. For instance, it is possible to save tables in
    text, XML and binary format at the same time.
  * With  "tspacketize"  and plugin "inject", it is now possible to load tables
    in  XML  format.  The options --binary and --xml have been added to specify
    the  file  type  if  its  name  is  neither  .bin nor .xml. It is no longer
    necessary to use the compiler to rebuild binary section files.
  * Added option --byte to "tsftrunc".
  * The options --verbose and --debug have been generalized to all commands.
  * For  programmers,  the  TSDuck  library API was extensively modified. Usage
    of  8-bit  strings (char* and std::string) has been removed and replaced by
    Java-like  Unicode strings (ts::UString). Many interface have been updated.
    The utilities in tsStringUtils have been removed. Equivalent services exist
    in  class ts::UString. All of this break the backward compatibility of user
    code.  This is unfortunate but TSDuck code is now more robust and faster to
    maintain.
  * The "revision" number is no longer a "build date" but a "commit count".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.4-20171110 (Nov 2017)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added  "t2mi"  plugin to extract encapsulated TS packets from T2-MI streams
    (DVB-T2 Modulator Interface).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * TSDuck  now  fully handles DVB character sets in signalization. All textual
    display  ("tsanalyze", "tstables", etc.) are produced in UTF-8 format, with
    characters  properly  translated  from  DVB  character  encoding. The table
    compiler,  "tstabcomp",  properly  translates  from  UTF-8 XML files to DVB
    character encoding and vice versa.
  * Added  options  --default-charset  and  --europe  to  "tspsi",  "tstables",
    "tstabdump", "tstabcomp", plugins "psi" and "tables".
  * T2-MI  PID's  and PLP's are now included in the report from "tsanalyze" and
    plugin "analyze".
  * Added --test option to "tslsdvb" on Windows.
  * Improved  robustness  of  DVB  tuner  detection  on Windows. It solves some
    issues  with  32-bit  tuner  filters  on 64-bit systems. But older systems,
    before  Windows 7 (XP, Vista, etc.), may no longer work. No further support
    will be provided for pre-7 Windows systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.3-20170930 (Sep 2017)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Removed  command  "tsgentab"  and  associated plugins.  This command is now
    obsolete  and  has  been  superseded  by  the more general "tstabcomp", the
    PSI/SI table compiler.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --interval to plugin "count".
  * Added option --default-pds  to  "tspsi",  "tstables",  "tstabdump", plugins
    "psi" and "tables".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed timer issues on Linux, typically seen in plugin "regulate".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.2-20170911 (Sep 2017)

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added the development environment in the Windows Installer. This is used to
    develop third-party applications using the TSDuck library. On Ubuntu, added
    the tsduck-dev package. On RPM-based distros, the tsduck-devel package
    already existed.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --no-duplicate to "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added  TSPLUGINS_PATH environment variable to use "tsp" plugins outside the
    directory of the TSDuck executables.
  * Added option --poll-file to plugin "inject".
  * Added option --pid to plugin descrambler.
  * Improved  robustness  of  option  --poll-file  in plugin "inject". Mitigate
    possible race conditions when the plugin tries to open a section file while
    it is created/copied by the user. Now retry later.
  * Improved  robustness  of  DVB  tuner  reception  on   Windows.   Explicitly
    resynchronizes on valid packets when the driver misses data.
  * Adjusted output of "tslsdvb" on Windows to better identify tuner names.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", the option --max-tables was not accurate
    when several small tables (eg. EMM's) were packed in the same TS packet.

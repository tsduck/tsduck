function Get-OSInfo {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Retrieves detailed information about the operating system version and architecture.

        .DESCRIPTION
        This function queries both the Windows registry and the Win32_OperatingSystem class to gather comprehensive information about the operating system. It returns details such as the release ID, display version, name, type (Workstation/Server), numeric version, edition ID, version (object that includes major, minor, and build numbers), and architecture (OS architecture, not processor architecture).

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-OSInfo

        This example retrieves the OS version details of the current system and returns an object with properties like ReleaseId, DisplayVersion, Name, Type, NumericVersion, EditionId, Version, and Architecture.

        .EXAMPLE
        (Get-OSInfo).Version.Major

        This example retrieves the major version number of the operating system. The Get-OSInfo function returns an object with a Version property, which itself is an object containing Major, Minor, and Build properties. You can access these sub-properties using dot notation.

        .EXAMPLE
        $osDetails = Get-OSInfo
        Write-Output "OS Name: $($osDetails.Name)"
        Write-Output "OS Type: $($osDetails.Type)"
        Write-Output "OS Architecture: $($osDetails.Architecture)"

        This example stores the result of Get-OSInfo in a variable and then accesses various properties to print details about the operating system.

            Handles common errors that may occur during an installation process.

            This function takes an ErrorRecord object and checks for certain known error codes.
            Depending on the error code, it writes appropriate warning messages or throws the error.

        .PARAMETER ErrorRecord
            The ErrorRecord object that represents the error that was caught. This object contains
            information about the error, including the exception that was thrown.

            This example shows how you might use the Handle-Error function in a try-catch block.
            If an error occurs in the try block, the catch block catches it and calls Handle-Error,

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
            Retrieves the current PowerShell process information.

        .DESCRIPTION
            The Get-CurrentProcess function identifies the current PowerShell process by temporarily changing the console window title. It then filters the list of running processes to find the one with the matching window title. The function returns a custom object containing the Name and Id of the current process.

        .EXAMPLE
            PS C:\> $result = Get-CurrentProcess
            PS C:\> Write-Output $result

            This example demonstrates how to call the Get-CurrentProcess function and store its output in a variable named $result. The output is then displayed using Write-Output.

        .NOTES
            The function temporarily changes the console window title. Ensure no other scripts or processes are dependent on the window title during execution. The function uses a 1-second sleep to allow time for the window title change to take effect. This may vary based on system performance.

function ExitWithDelay {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
            Exits the script with a specified exit code after a specified delay, 10 seconds by default.

        .DESCRIPTION
            This function takes an exit code as an argument, waits for 10 seconds unless specified, and then exits the script with the given exit code.

        .PARAMETER ExitCode
            The exit code to use when exiting the script.

        .EXAMPLE
            ExitWithDelay -ExitCode 1
            Waits for 10 seconds (default) and then exits the script with an exit code of 1.

        .EXAMPLE
            ExitWithDelay -ExitCode 2 -Seconds 5
            Waits for 5 seconds and then exits the script with an exit code of 2.
        .NOTES
            Use this function to introduce a delay before exiting the script, allowing time for any cleanup or logging activities.

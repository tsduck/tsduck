# Building TSDuck binary packages

Free and open-source products are still products. As such, they deserve proper
packaging for their binaries. A free and open-source product shall be as easy to
install as any other expensive software product.

This directory contains tools and instructions to build TSDuck binary packages
and installers on the various platforms. Each subdirectory is dedicated to a
given type of packaging or release publication.

The script `build-remote.sh` builds the TSDuck installers on a remote system,
either a running physical system or a local VM to start.

[.cmd-header]
Generate and inject EIT's in a transport stream

This plugin generates EIT's from a database of events and injects those EIT's on time in the transport stream.
The plugin can selectively generate "EIT actual" and/or "EIT other" and "EIT present/following" (or "p/f") and/or "EIT schedule".

EIT's are "injected" in the transport stream by replacing null packets or pre-existing EIT packets.
All EIT's are injected by default in the DVB-defined PID for EIT's, the PID number 18 (see also option `--pid`).
There must be enough null or EIT packets to replace, otherwise EIT's won't be correctly injected or not injected at all.

The events can be loaded at any time but the actual EIT injection can start only
when the actual transport stream id and the current time reference are known.
The actual transport stream id is required to determine if events for a given service shall be included in EIT actual or EIT other.
The current time is required to generate EIT p/f on time and drop obsolete events from EIT schedule.
The organization of EIT schedule table ids also depends on the current date.

By default, the actual transport stream id is extracted from the first PAT.
The current time is permanently resynchronized on TDT and TOT.
See also options `--ts-id` and `--time`.

Note that the concept of "current time" is always relative to the transport stream.
It is possible to inject EIT's in a transport stream file at the speed of file read/write.
The "current time" of a packet (for EIT generation and insertion) is based on the last reference
(typically from a TDT or TOT), the transport stream bitrate and the number of packets since the last reference.

==== Electronic Program Guide (EPG) database

The events are loaded in an EPG database in memory.
There are several sources for events: files and incoming EIT's (from the TS upstream).

Event files shall contain EIT tables or sections in binary, XML or JSON format.
The organization of events in the EIT's and the type of EIT's are ignored.
Only the events descriptions and the DVB triplets (service id, transport stream id and original network id) are important,
all the rest is ignored.

When event files are loaded or when incoming EIT's are received,
all events are individually extracted and stored in the EPG database in memory.
The EIT encapsulation is just a convenient pre-existing format to store events, nothing more.

Events are reorganized by the plugin `eitinject` and new EIT's are recreated when necessary
with the stored events.

The event input files can be specified using wildcards
(be sure to use quotes in order to avoid the interpretation of the wildcards by the shell).
The plugin `eitinject` polls the corresponding files at regular intervals.
Whenever a file matching the wildcards is created or updated, the file is loaded.
Existing events with unmodified content are ignored.

Let's take an example. Consider the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ tsp ... -P eitinject --file '/home/epg/input/*.xml' --delete-files ...
----

Each time XML files are copied into the directory `/home/epg/input`, they are loaded and all events
from all EIT's in those files are processed.
Most of the time, "processed" means loaded and added in the EPG database
(see an exception in the next section on event deletion).

Each XML files is then deleted after being loaded (option `--delete-files`).

Note the quotes in `'/home/epg/input/{asterisk}.xml'`.
Without them, the shell would expand the wildcard with all existing XML files in directory `/home/epg/input`.
The plugin `eitinject` would then only consider these files, those which existed at the time the command was started.
With the quotes, the shell does not expand the wildcard and the raw string with `{asterisk}.xml` is passed to the plugin
and all present and future XML files in that directory will be loaded.

Consider the following XML file:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<tsduck>
  <EIT service_id="1" transport_stream_id="4" original_network_id="1">

    <event event_id="1000" start_time="2020-07-01 00:10:00" duration="00:20:00">
      <short_event_descriptor language_code="foo">
        <event_name>Event 1000</event_name>
      </short_event_descriptor>
    </event>

    <event event_id="1001" start_time="2020-07-01 00:30:00" duration="00:30:00">
      <short_event_descriptor language_code="foo">
        <event_name>Event 1001</event_name>
      </short_event_descriptor>
    </event>

    <event event_id="1002" start_time="2020-07-01 01:00:00" duration="00:30:00">
      <short_event_descriptor language_code="foo">
        <event_name>Event 1002</event_name>
      </short_event_descriptor>
    </event>

  </EIT>
</tsduck>
----

When we copy this file into the directory `/home/epg/input`, three consecutive events are loaded into the EPG database.
They are included in further EIT schedule for the service id 1 in transport stream with id 4.
If some of these events become present or following in the service, they are immediately included in EIT p/f.

If the transport stream id of the TS is 4, the events are included in an EIT Actual.
Otherwise, they are included in an EIT Other.

==== Deleting events from the EPG database

Events are automatically removed from the EPG database when they become obsolete
(the current transport stream time goes beyong the end time of the event).

Deleting an event in advance is possible using the same type of files as used to load events.
When an EIT is read from a XML or JSON file, if the metadata of that EIT contains `attribute="delete"`,
all events from that EIT are deleted from the EPG database (if they exist).
These events are removed from the next EIT schedule or present/following for the corresponding period.

In EIT's with metadata `attribute="delete"`, only the event id is used in each event.
Date, times and all descriptors are ignored. The events with the corresponding ids are
searched in the EPG database and deleted. Nothing more.

See xref:table-metadata[xrefstyle=short] for more details on metadata in XML or JSON tables.

NOTE: Because metadata are not part of the table content, it is not possible to delete events
using EIT binary files. Only XML and JSON representations can contain metadata for tables.

Using the example above, let's assume that "Event 1001" needs to be cancelled before or during being broadcasted.
To remove it from the EPG, simply copy the following XML file into the directory `/home/epg/input`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<tsduck>
  <EIT service_id="1" transport_stream_id="4" original_network_id="1">
    <metadata attribute="delete"/>
    <event event_id="1001" start_time="2020-07-01 00:30:00" duration="00:30:00"/>
  </EIT>
</tsduck>
----

Because of the `<metadata attribute="delete"/>`, all events are deleted.
Here, the event with id 1001 is deleted.

Note that the start time and duration attributes are here only because they are required by the syntax of the EIT.
They are ignored and their values do not need to match the actual schedule for the event.

==== Injection profiles

The EIT's are injected and cycled according to ETSI TS 101 211 section 4.4 (see <<ETSI-101-211>>).
Several cycle profiles can be used.
A profile defines the repetition cycle of each type of EIT.

The default profile is defined in <<ETSI-101-211>> for satellite and cable networks.
It is possible to select the profile for terrestrial networks (generating a lower EIT bandwidth).
In addition to a predefined profile, it is possible to tune individual cycle values.

EIT schedule are divided into two periods:

* The _prime_ period extends over the next few days.
  The repetition rate of those EIT's is typically longer than EIT present/following but still reasonably fast.
  The duration in days of the prime period depends on the type of network.
* The _later_ period includes all events after the prime period.
  The repetition rate of those EIT's is typically longer that in the prime period.

The following table lists the details of the two standard EIT profiles as defined in ETSI TS 101 211.

[.opt]
*-d* +
*--delete-files*

[.optdoc]
Specifies that the event input files should be deleted after being loaded.

[.optdoc]
By default, the files are left unmodified after being loaded.

[.optdoc]
When a loaded file is modified later, it is reloaded and re-injected.

[.opt]
*--event-offset* _seconds_

[.optdoc]
Specifies an offset in seconds to add to the start time of all loaded events.
The value can be positive or negative.

[.optdoc]
By default, no offset is applied.

[.optdoc]
See also option `--input-event-offset`.

[.opt]
*-f* _'file-wildcard'_ +
*--files* _'file-wildcard'_

[.optdoc]
A file specification with optional wildcards indicating which event files should be polled.
When such a file is created or updated, it is loaded and its content is interpreted as binary, XML or JSON tables.

[.optdoc]
If the specified name contains wildcards,
be sure to surround it with quotes to prevent the interpretation of the wildcards by the shell.

[.optdoc]
All tables shall be EIT's.
The structure and organization of events inside the input EIT tables is ignored.
All events are individually extracted from the EIT tables and loaded in the EPG.
They are later reorganized in the injected EIT's p/f and schedule.
In the input files, the EIT structure shall be only considered as a convenient format to describe events.

[.opt]
*--incoming-eits*

[.optdoc]
Load events from incoming EIT's in the EPG.
A typical use case is the generation of EIT p/f from EIT schedule.

[.optdoc]
By default, events are loaded from EIT files only.

[.optdoc]
Since events must be loaded from somewhere, either `--incoming-eits` or `--files` must be specified.
If both are specified, events are merged from the two sources.

[.opt]
*--input-event-offset* _seconds_

[.optdoc]
With `--incoming-eits`, specifies an offset in seconds to add to the start time
of all events from the input EIT PID. The value can be positive or negative.

[.optdoc]
By default, the same offset is applied as specified with `--event-offset`.

[.opt]
*--lazy-schedule-update*

[.optdoc]
When an event completes, do not remove it from the current EIT schedule segment.
Obsolete events are removed from the EPG only when their 3-hour segment is completed.

[.optdoc]
By default, each time an event completes, the EIT schedule section which contains that event is updated
(the terminated event is removed).

[.optdoc]
With this option, EIT schedule update is less frequent and the load on the plugin and the receiver is lower.
This option is recommended with `--synchronous-versions`
where all sections of an EIT schedule sub-table are updated each time one of them is updated.

[.opt]
*--min-stable-delay* _milliseconds_

[.optdoc]
An input file size needs to be stable during that duration, in milliseconds, for the file to be reported as added or modified.
This prevents too frequent poll notifications when a file is being written and his size modified at each poll.

[.optdoc]
The default is 500 ms.

[.opt]
*--other*

[.optdoc]
Generate all EIT other.
Same as `--other-pf --other-schedule`.

[.opt]
*--other-pf*

[.optdoc]
Generate EIT p/f other.
If no EIT selection option is specified, all EIT's are generated.

[.opt]
*--other-schedule*

[.optdoc]
Generate EIT schedule actual.
If no EIT selection option is specified, all EIT's are generated.

[.opt]
*--pf*

[.optdoc]
Generate all EIT p/f (present/following).
Same as `--actual-pf --other-pf`.

[.opt]
*-p* _value_ +
*--pid* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the PID for EIT injection.

[.optdoc]
The default is 18, the standard PID for EIT's.

[.opt]
*--poll-interval* _milliseconds_

[.optdoc]
Interval, in milliseconds, between two poll operations to detect new or modified input files.

[.optdoc]
The default is 500 ms.

[.opt]
*--prime-days* _value_

[.optdoc]
Duration, in days, of the "prime" period for EIT schedule.
EIT schedule for events in the prime period (i.e. the next few days)
are repeated more frequently than EIT schedule for later events.

[.optdoc]
The default is 8 days.

[.opt]
*--schedule*

[.optdoc]
Generate all EIT schedule.
Same as `--actual-schedule --other-schedule`.

[.opt]
*--stuffing*

[.optdoc]
Insert stuffing inside TS packets at end of EIT sections.
Do not pack EIT sections.

[.optdoc]
By default, EIT sections are packed.

[.opt]
*--synchronous-versions*

[.optdoc]
Keep version numbers synchronous on all sections of an EIT sub-table.

[.optdoc]
By default, since EIT's are sparse sections and not full tables,
the version number of an EIT section is updated only when the section is modified.
This is more efficient and reduces the load on the receivers.

[.optdoc]
An EIT schedule sub-table is an aggregate of sparse sections which covers an EPG duration of 4 days.
There are between 32 and 256 sections in an EIT schedule sub-table.
Using this option, all sections are regenerated each time one event is updated.
Consequently, the load on the receivers is much higher.
Using it should be reserved for situations where some receivers are unable to update individual EIT sections.
It is also recommended to specify `--lazy-schedule-update` with `--synchronous-versions`.

[.opt]
*--terrestrial*

[.optdoc]
Use the EIT cycle profile for terrestrial networks as specified in ETSI TS 101 211, section 4.4.

[.optdoc]
By default, use the cycle profile for satellite and cable networks from the same standard.

[.optdoc]
See also options `--cycle-*` and `--prime-days` to modify individual values.

[.opt]
*--time* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the UTC date & time reference for the first packet in the stream.
Then, the time reference is updated according to the number of packets and the bitrate.

[.optdoc]
The time value must be in the format `YYYY/MM/DD:hh:mm:ss`.

[.optdoc]
The predefined name `system` can be used to specify the current UTC time from the system clock
(use `--time system`).

[.optdoc]
By default, the current time is resynchronized on all TDT and TOT.

[.optdoc]
EIT injection starts when the time reference and actual transport stream id are known.

[.opt]
*--ts-id* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the actual transport stream id.
This is used to differentiate events for EIT actual and EIT other.

[.optdoc]
By default, the actual transport stream id is read from the PAT.

[.optdoc]
EIT injection starts when the actual transport stream id and time reference are known.

[.opt]
*-w* +
*--wait-first-batch*

[.optdoc]
When this option is specified, the start of the plugin is suspended until the first batch of events is loaded from files.
Without this option, the input files are asynchronously loaded.

[.optdoc]
This option is typically useful when inserting events into a transport stream file.
Since files are read much faster than the normal playout speed,
it is possible that the input transport stream file is already mostly processed when the event files are loaded.
With this option, we have the guarantee that the event files are loaded before the transport stream processing starts.

[.optdoc]
On the other hand, this option should not be used on live transport streams.
In that case, the transport stream processing must be allowed to start without event to inject.
The EIT's may be sent much later.

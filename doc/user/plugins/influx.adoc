[.cmd-header]
Send live metrics to InfluxDB, a data source for Grafana

By default, the plugin sends the global transport stream bitrate at regular intervals (5 seconds by default).

Other options include:

[.compact-list]
* Bitrate information by PID, by type of PID (audio, video, etc.), by service.
* Last PCR/PTS/DTS timestamp values by PID, by service.
* Error counters as defined in <<ETSI-101-290>>.
* Inter-packet Arrival Time (IAT) for datagram-based inputs.

Be careful to send the required information for your graph only.
Sending bitrate information for all PID's, all types of PID's, and all services,
every second, may overload the InfluxDB database. Do some benchmarking first.

Even though InfluxDB is typically used as a Grafana data source,
the collected data can be used by other applications for analytics, monitoring, etc.

[.usage]
Timing options

[.opt]
*-i* _seconds_ +
*--interval* _seconds_

[.optdoc]
Interval in seconds between metrics reports to InfluxDB.

[.optdoc]
The default is 5 seconds. This is usually the minimal update interval in Grafana.

[.opt]
*--local-time*

[.optdoc]
Transmit timestamps as local time, based on the current system configuration.

[.optdoc]
By default, timestamps are transmitted as UTC time.

[.opt]
*--max-metrics* _count_

[.optdoc]
Terminate `tsp` after sending the specified number of metrics.
This is a test option. The processing is never stopped by default.

[.opt]
*--pcr-based*

[.optdoc]
Use playout time based on PCR values.
By default, the time is based on the wall-clock time (real time).

[.opt]
*--start-time* _year/month/day:hour:minute:second_

[.optdoc]
With `--pcr-based` or `--timestamp-based`, specify the initial date and time reference.

[.optdoc]
By default, with `--pcr-based` or `--timestamp-based`, the activity starts at the first UTC time which is found in a DVB TDT or ATSC STT.

[.opt]
*--timestamp-based*

[.optdoc]
Use playout time based on timestamp values from the input plugin.
When input timestamps are not available or not monotonic, fallback to `--pcr-based`.
By default, the time is based on the wall-clock time (real time).

[.usage]
Monitored information options

[.opt]
*-a* +
*--all-pids*

[.optdoc]
Send metrics data for all PID's.
Equivalent to `--pid 0-8191`.

[.opt]
*--bitrate*

[.optdoc]
Send bitrate monitoring data.

[.optdoc]
This option is only useful in addition to `--pcr`, `--pts`, `--dts`, `--tr-101-290`.
Otherwise, this is the default.

[.opt]
*--dts*

[.optdoc]
Send the last DTS value in a set of PID and/or services.
Also specify at least one of `--pid`, `--all-pids`, `--services`.

[.opt]

[.optdoc]
Send metrics on Inter-packet Arrival Time (IAT) for datagram-based inputs (`ip`, `pcap`, `srt`, `rist`).
Ignored if the input is not datagram-based.

[.optdoc]
See xref:_iat[xrefstyle=short] the documentation of plugin `iat` for more details on inter-packet arrival times.

[.opt]
*--max-severity* _value_

[.optdoc]
With `--tr-101-290`, specify the maximum severity of error counters to send.
<<ETSI-101-290>> defines severity from 1 (most severe) to 3 (less severe).
TSDuck adds informational counters at severity 4.

[.optdoc]
By default, all error counters are sent.

[.opt]
*-n* +
*--names*

[.optdoc]
With `--services`, the services are identified in InfluxDB by their name, when available.
Services without name are identified by their id in decimal.

[.opt]

[.optdoc]
Send metrics data for the specified PID's.
The PID's are identified in InfluxDB by their value in decimal.

[.optdoc]
Several `--pid` options may be specified.
To save bandwidth and database space, PID's with no packets during an interval are not reported for that interval.

[.opt]
*--pts*

[.optdoc]
Send the last PTS value in a set of PID and/or services.
Also specify at least one of `--pid`, `--all-pids`, `--services`.

The services are identified in InfluxDB by their id in decimal.

[.opt]
*--tr-101-290*

[.optdoc]
Send error counters as defined in <<ETSI-101-290>>.
This plugin can detect a subset of ETSI TR 101 290 only:
all transport stream logical checks are performed but physical checks on modulation cannot be reported.
See more details below.

[.optdoc]
By default, all defined error counters are sent at each interval for the whole transport stream,
even when the counter value is zero.
In addition, if `--services` or `--pid` or `--all-pids` are specified, each counter is also sent
for each service or PID, only when the counter value is not zero.
The scope of each counter, transport stream, service, or PID, is specified in the tag `scope`.
See more details below.

[.opt]
*--type*

[.optdoc]
Send bitrate metrics data by type of PID's (audio, video, subtitles, PSI, etc.)
See more details below.

==== Building Flux queries for Grafana

This plugin sends metrics data to InfluxDB.
On top of that, the user has to build Flux queries in Grafana to extract the appropriate data to visualize.
This section describes the precise metrics which are sent to InfluxDB.
The provided information shall be used to build Flux queries.

At each specified interval (option `--interval`), this plugin sends a list of metrics entries.

A time stamp is always provided with each data entry.
Depending on the plugin options, this can be a local time or a UTC time,
a wall-clock time or a time which is extracted from the stream.

The following table lists the possible types of the field `_measurement` and the semantics of the corresponding field `_value`.
The `_value` type is `float` (in practice, an integer value is provided).
The tags are present for all occurrences of the corresponding `_measurement`.
The presence of the secondary tags depend on the `scope` tag.

==== Custom identification of metrics

It is possible to add user-defined tags to build a custom identification.
This can be useful if several instances of the plugin `influx` send metrics to the same bucket.

Consider the following defaut metrics, sending the global bitrate of the TS.

[source,text]
----
bitrate,scope=ts,tsid=4 value=22936796 1548161530912
----

Following the format which is defined by InfluxDB, we see the following components:

[.compact-list]
* The first identifier `bitrate` defines the type of _measurement_, here a bitrate.
* The following fields `scope` and `tsid` are _tags_. They can be used as filters in Flux queries.
* The `value` field is the numerical value of the measurement. Its interpretation depends on the type of measurement.
* The last numerical field is the timestamp of the measurement.

Using `-P influx --tag operator=tvsat --tag satellite=sat1`, the two user-specified tags are added to all metrics.
The previous metrics become:

[source,text]
----
bitrate,scope=ts,tsid=4,operator=tvsat,satellite=sat1 value=22936796 1548161530912
----

Using that kind of custom identification, it is possible to build complex Flux queries to select metrics
from specific user-identified sources.

==== Bitrate metrics

Each entry contains the following information:

[.compact-list]
* Field `_measurement`: `bitrate`.
* Field `_value`: the bitrate in bits/second during the measurement period.
* Tag `scope`: an identifier defining the scope of the bitrate value.
  The possible values are `ts` (total bitrate of the transport stream),
  `service` (accumulated bitrate of all PID's in a service), `pid` (bitrate of one PID),
  or `type` (accumulated bitrate of all PID's of a given type).
* Tag `tsid`: this is the transport stream id as an integer.
* Tag `service`: when `scope=service`, this is the service name or service id as an integer,
  or `global` for all global PID's (ie. not attached to any service).
* Tag `pid`: when `scope=pid`, this is the PID as an integer.
* Tag `type`: when `scope=type`, this is one of `audio`, `data`, `ecm`, `emm`, `pcr`, `psi`,
  `stuffing`, `subtitles`, `undefined`, `video`.

Note that if a PID is shared between several services,
its bitrate is included in the bitrate of all services it belongs to.
In that case, the sum of the bitrate of all services is greater than the global TS bitrate.

To reduce the amount of logged data, bitrates with value zero are not sent.
For instance, using option `--all-pids`, a `pid` record is sent only for PID's with a non-zero bitrate during that interval.

[.usage]
Examples

By default, InfluxDB receives the following data:

[source,text]
----
bitrate,scope=ts,tsid=4 value=22936796 1548161530912

bitrate,scope=service,tsid=4,service=global value=231915 1548161530912
----

==== Timestamp metrics (PCR, PTS, DTS)

Each entry contains the following information:

[.compact-list]
* Field `_measurement`: one of `pcr`, `pts`, `dts`, depending on the type of timestamp.
* Field `_value`: the raw value of the last timestamp of that type in the measurement period.
* Tag `scope`: an identifier defining the scope of the bitrate value.
  The possible values are `service` (last timestamp in any PID of a service), `pid` (last timestamp in one PID).
* Tag `tsid`: this is the transport stream id as an integer.
* Tag `service`: when `scope=service`, this is the service name or service id as an integer.
* Tag `pid`: when `scope=pid`, this is the PID as an integer.

[.usage]
Examples

With options `--pcr --services --names`, InfluxDB receives the following data:

[source,text]
----
bitrate,scope=ts,tsid=4 value=22936796 1548161530912
pcr,scope=service,tsid=4,service=M6 value=1783513330866 1548161530912

pcr,scope=service,tsid=4,service=6ter value=1790246369026 1548161530912
----

==== IAT metrics

Each entry contains the following information:

[.compact-list]
* Field `_measurement`: `iat`.
* Field `_value`: the value of the inter-packet arrival time in microseconds.
* Tag `type`: one of `mean`, `min` or `max`, indicating the type of metrics.

[.usage]
Examples

With options `--iat`, InfluxDB receives the following data:

[source,text]
----
bitrate,scope=ts,tsid=1 value=1009504 1760132351779
iat,type=mean value=10436 1760132351779
iat,type=min value=9547 1760132351779
iat,type=max value=13487 1760132351779
----

NOTE: There are some operating system specificities in measuring IAT.
See xref:_iat[xrefstyle=short] the documentation of plugin `iat` for more details.

==== ETSI TR 101 290 error counter metrics

With option `--tr-101-290`, each metrics entry contains one error counter for the last measurement interval.

Each entry contains the following information:

[.compact-list]
* Field `_measurement`: `counter`.
* Field `_value`: the value of the counter, typically a number of errors.
* Tag `name`: name of the error counter, as defined in <<ETSI-101-290>>, lowercase.
* Tag `severity`: an integer value from 1 to 4, defining the severity of the error.
  The severity 1 (most severe) to 3 (less severe) are defined by <<ETSI-101-290>>
  in sections 5.2.1 to 5.2.3. The severity 4 (informational) is added by TSDuck.
* Tag `scope`: an identifier defining the scope of the counter.
  The possible values are `ts` (counter for all PID's in the transport stream),
  `service` (counter for all PID's in a service), or `pid` (counter for one PID).
* Tag `tsid`: this is the transport stream id as an integer.
* Tag `service`: when `scope=service`, this is the service name or service id as an integer,
  or `global` for all global PID's (ie. not attached to any service).
* Tag `pid`: when `scope=pid`, this is the PID as an integer.

The following table lists all rules which are implemented in this plugin and which
error counter is incremented. The reference "x.y" is the rule number in <<ETSI-101-290>> section 5.2.
In "x.y/z", "z" is a sequence number when the same rule includes distinct checks.
In "x.y/zU", "U" means unreferenced in <<ETSI-101-290>>, a new rule which seems necessary.

The first colum of the table indicates which rules are implemented (X) and which are not (-).
The severity is the first digit "x" in "x.y/z".
The descriptions of the rule are directly copied from <<ETSI-101-290>>.

----

With options `--tr-101-290 --services --all-pids --max-severity 3`, the counters are
added per service and per PID, when non-zero. All global counters, with `scope=ts`,
are always sent, even they are zero.

Note that, when logging counters for all PID's, it is recommended to use `--max-severity 3`.
Otherwise, all informational counters, with severity 4, are also logged. Because these
counters include `packet_count` (the number of packets per PID or per service), these
counters are never zero and tend to overflow InfluxDB.

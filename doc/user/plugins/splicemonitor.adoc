[.cmd-header]
Monitor SCTE 35 splice information

This plugin monitors splice information sections, as defined by the <<SCTE-35>> standard.
The event reference, the number of occurrences of each command and the time between the command
and the event itself (sometimes called _pre-roll time_) are displayed.

[.usage]
Usage

[source,shell]
----
$ tsp -P splicemonitor [options]

[.usage]
Options

[.opt]
*--alarm-command* _"command"_

[.optdoc]
Command to run when a splice event is outside the nominal range as specified by other `--min` and `--max` options.

[.optdoc]
The command receives seven additional parameters:

[.optdoc]
[.compact-list]
1. A human-readable message, the same as logged by the plugin.
2. The PID of the splice command.
3. The event id.
4. The string `in` or `out` for splice in / splice out command.
5. The adjusted PTS value in the splice command.
6. Pre-roll time in milliseconds. This is the time between the first occurrence of a splice command and the corresponding event.
7. Number of occurences of the command before the event.

[.optdoc]
These parameters can be used or ignored by the alarm command.

[.opt]
*-a* +
*--all-commands*

[.optdoc]
Same as `--display-commands` but display all SCTE-35 splice information commands.
This is equivalent to `--select-commands 0-255`.

[.optdoc]
By default, only display splice insert commands.

[.opt]
*-d* +
*--display-commands*

[.optdoc]
Display the content of SCTE-35 splice insert commands.

[.optdoc]
By default, only log a short event description.

[.opt]
*--max-pre-roll-time* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify a maximum pre-roll time in milliseconds for splice commands.

[.optdoc]
See option `--alarm-command` for the processing of non-nominal cases.

[.opt]
*--max-repetition* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify a maximum number of repetitions for each splice command.

[.optdoc]
See option `--alarm-command` for the processing of non-nominal cases.

[.opt]
*--meta-sections*

[.optdoc]
Add an hexadecimal dump of each section in the XML and JSON metadata.

[.opt]
*--min-pre-roll-time* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify a minimum pre-roll time in milliseconds for splice commands.

[.optdoc]
See option `--alarm-command` for the processing of non-nominal cases.

[.opt]
*--min-repetition* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify a minimum number of repetitions for each splice command.

[.optdoc]
See option `--alarm-command` for the processing of non-nominal cases.

[.opt]
*-n* +
*--no-adjustment*

[.optdoc]
When computing the anticipated pre-roll time at reception of a splice command,
do not try to adjust the time using the distance between the last PTS and the splice command.

[.optdoc]
By default, use the bitrate to adjust the supposed PTS of the splice command itself.

[.opt]
*-o* _file-name_ +
*--output-file* _file-name_

[.optdoc]
Specify an output text file.
With `--json`, this will be a JSON file.

[.optdoc]
By default, use the message logging system for short messages and the standard output with `--display-commands`.

[.opt]
*-i* +
*--packet-index*

[.optdoc]
Display the current TS packet index for each message or event.

[.opt]
*--select-commands* _value1[-value2]_

[.optdoc]
Same as `--display-commands` but display the specified SCTE-35 command types only.

[.optdoc]
By default, only display splice insert commands.

[.optdoc]
Several `--select-commands` can be specified.

[.opt]
*-s* _value_ +
*--splice-pid* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify one single PID carrying SCTE-35 sections to monitor.

[.optdoc]
By default, all SCTE-35 PID's are monitored, based in their signalization in the PMT's.

[.opt]
*--tag* _'string'_

[.optdoc]
Leading tag to be displayed with each message.
Useful when the plugin is used several times in the same process.

[.opt]
*-t* _value_ +
*--time-pid* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify one video or audio PID containing PTS timestamps to link with SCTE-35 sections to monitor.

[.optdoc]
By default, the PMT's are used to link between PTS PID's and SCTE-35 PID's.

[.opt]
*--timestamp*

[.optdoc]
Add a timestamp (current local time) inside each JSON structure (tables and events).

[.usage]
JSON logging options

[.opt]
*-j* +
*--json*

[.optdoc]
Build a JSON description of the splice event (see option `--output-file`).

[.optdoc]
When `--all-commands` is specified, each SCTE-35 table is initially formatted as XML and an automated XML-to-JSON conversion is applied.
See xref:xml-json-conv[xrefstyle=short] for more details on XML-to-JSON conversion.

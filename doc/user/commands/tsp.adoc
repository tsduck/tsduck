Transport stream processor

The transport stream processor is a general-purpose packet processing framework.

It receives an MPEG Transport Stream from a user-specified input plugin,
applies MPEG packet processing through several user-specified packet processor plugins,
and sends the processed stream to a user-specified output plugin.

All input, packet processing, and output plugins are shared libraries
(`.so` files on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS, `.dll` on Windows).

The following figure illustrates the structure of a `tsp` process using three packet processing plugins.

.Transport stream processor diagram

This section describes the general syntax and usage of the `tsp` command.
All plugins are documented in detail, in alphabetical order, in xref:chap-plugins[xrefstyle=short].
The xref:tsp-examples[xrefstyle=short] gives a few examples of `tsp` commands, both simple and complex examples.

[.usage]
Usage

The general syntax of the tsp command is the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ tsp [tsp-options] \
      [-I input-name [input-options]] \
      [-P processor-name [processor-options]] ... \
      [-O output-name [output-options]]
----

All `_tsp-options_` must be placed on the command line before the input, packet processing and output plugin specifications.
There must be at most one input and one output plugin.
There may be any number of packet processing plugins.

On the command line, the order of the packet processing plugins is significant:
the TS packets are passed from one processor to the other in this order.
The input and output plugin, however, can be located anywhere on the command line.
They are implicitly used as first and last plugin in the chain, respectively.

==== Offline and real-time defaults

There are two main classes of usage for `tsp`, offline and real-time processing.
Offline processing works on static data such as transport stream files without specific timing constraints.
Real-time processing applies to streaming devices such as tuners, Dektec devices or IP streams.

In the `tsp` command and in many plugins, some command line options affect tuning and performances.
Roughly, we have to find a balance between throughput and latency.

* To get a higher throughput, we must minimize the data copy and thread context switching operations.
  This is achieved using larger buffer sizes and letting plugins work on larger amounts of TS packets.
  This requires less CPU and provides better overall performances.
  But this also has the side effect of increasing the latency.
* To get a lower latency, we must basically do the opposite:
  work on smaller data chunks, pass data faster (more frequently) from plugin to plugin.
  The drawback is an increase of CPU requirement.

There is no unique choice.
When working on offline files, increasing the throughput and reducing the CPU load is the right choice.
But for streaming and real-time processing, reducing the latency is the priority.

To optimize the offline or real-time processing, many tuning options can be adjusted.
While fine tuning is sometimes useful, the user mainly needs two sets of default options: offline or real-time.

By default, `tsp` and all plugins use the offline defaults,
the tuning options which give good performances at the expense of a higher latency.

The real-time defaults are used without having to specify all individual options in two cases:

* The option `-r` or `--realtime` is specified in the `tsp` command line.
* At least one plugin in the chain is designed to work in real-time.

In these two cases, `tsp` and all plugins use their real-time defaults (unless, of course, options are individually set).

The second condition, "designed to work in real-time", is an intrinsic property of a plugin.
Examples of "real-time" plugins include `dvb`, `dektec`, `ip`, `play` or `regulate`.
These plugins are somehow designed to work on real-time streams.
Their simple presence in the `tsp` command is sufficient to trigger the use of real-time defaults for all plugins.
It is still possible to force the use of offline defaults using the `tsp` option `--realtime=off`,
even if a real-time plugin is present.

==== Rendering speed and transmission speed

With `tsp`, a stream has a _rendering speed_ (the speed of the audio / video) and a _transmission speed_
(the speed at which packets go through `tsp`).

As a general rule, the word _bitrate_ refers to the rendering speed.
So, when a plugin inserts data with a "bitrate of 100 kb/s" for instance,
this means that the data will be received at this bitrate when the transport stream is played in real time
(independently of the file processing speed, if the data insertion was previously performed on an offline file).

It is important to understand the differences between the two.
Real-time streams, from broadcast or multicast, have identical transmission and rendering speeds
because they are transmitted to watch TV.
Files, on the other hand, have a very high transmission speed, typically the I/O speed of the disk,
maybe 1 Gb/s or more on SSD.

Some plugins explicitly manipulate the rendering or transmission speed.
The plugin `pcrbitrate`, for instance, is designed to evaluate the rendering speed based on embedded timestamps in the stream.
The plugin `regulate`, on the other hand, is designed to alter the transmission speed.

Let's review some examples of where these plugins should be used.

Consider that you have recorded a 6 Mb/s single program transport stream,
and you want to send it through UDP/IP to a remote media player.
Using `tsp -I file`, you read it and send it to `-O ip`.
The effective reading speed of the file will be 500 M/b for instance.
So, on a gigabit network, you send a 6 Mb/s video stream at 1 Gb/s, 166 times faster as it should be.
Thus, a 15 minute video is received in 5 seconds and the player displays almost nothing.
In this case, you must use the plugin `regulate` between `-I file` and `-O ip`.
The plugin acts as a bottleneck and lets packets flow out at 6 Mb/s only.

But, when the source has the same transmission and rendering speeds (DVB tuner, IP source),
the plugin `regulate` is useless.
At best, it does nothing.
At worst, it introduces undesirable artifacts.
There are also cases where the transmission speed regulation is done automatically.
If the media player is a local application such as VLC and is started using `-O play`,
`tsp` communicates with the player through a pipe.
A pipe is a self-regulated communication mechanism.
So, even if the input is a disk file with a high reading speed,
using `regulate` is not necessary because the same role is played here by the pipe.
The difference with the previous example is that UDP/IP is not a regulated communication channel,
unlike pipes and TCP/IP.

==== Bitrate propagation

At any point in the chain, all plugins have some knowledge of the transport stream bitrate or rendering speed.
Some plugins use that bitrate information, some others don't.
The plugin `regulate` is a typical example.
It uses the rendering speed as information to lower the transmission speed.
As a general rule, `tsp` collects the input bitrate,
either from the input plugin itself which extracts the bitrate from a hardware input device
(this is the case for ASI cards for instance) or,
if the input plugin is not able to report a bitrate, `tsp` automatically analyzes PCR's
at the output of the input plugin and computes the corresponding bitrate.

Then, the bitrate is transmitted from plugin to plugin.

Some plugins may inadvertently propagate incorrect bitrates while some plugins may force a (correct) recomputation of the bitrate.
To illustrate the first case, consider `-I file ... -P zap ...` using sample bitrate values.
You read a complete 36 Mb/s input file and `tsp` evaluates this bitrate.
Then, `-P zap` extracts a 4 Mb/s service and removes everything else.
But it does not recompute the transport stream bitrate.
So, the propagated bitrate information is still 36 Mb/s.
If this information is not used downstream in other plugins, we don't care.
But if we use the bitrate information in `-P regulate -O ip` for instance,
we will regulate at 36 Mb/s a stream which should be played at 4 Mb/s.
This is why, in specific situations like this, we need to recompute the bitrate using `-P pcrbitrate` before `-P regulate`.

==== Input timestamps

For each input packet, an _input timestamp_ is collected.
When the source can provide its own timestamps (RTP, SRT, M2TS file), this value is used.
Otherwise, `tsp` uses the system time after the input plugin returns a bulk of packets.
When an input plugin is able to generate its own input timestamps, its documentation describes how this is accomplished.

The input timestamps are propagated all along the chain of plugins.
Some plugins may use them.
For instance:

* The plugin `pcrverify` can use them as time reference.
* The output plugin `file` uses them to create files in M2TS format.

[#inserting-packets]
==== Modifying, inserting and deleting packets

In the complete chain of processing, between the input and the output plugin, each TS packet goes through
all packet processing plugins, one after the other, in the order of the command line.

NOTE: In fact, a TS packet never _moves_. It is loaded in a large circular buffer and stays there.
Each plugin uses a sliding window over the circular buffer and inspects or modifies packets without moving them.

A packet processing plugin may read, modify or delete existing packets.
*But it cannot add new packets*.

Roughly, each packet processing plugin has one of the following functions
(or sometimes a combination of them):

* Analysis (read packets).
* Modification (modify existing packets).
* Removal (delete packets from the stream).
* Data injection (add new packets).

The last case cannot be directly implemented.
To achieve data injection, a plugin usually _steals_ stuffing.
Each time a new TS packet needs to be injected,
a plugin waits for the next _null packet_ (i.e. a packet in PID 0x1FFF)
and replaces this null packet with the new packet to insert.

Consequently, the original amount of stuffing and its distribution in a stream
directly influences the insertion profile of new packets.
Specifically, it is not possible to add more data than the stuffing bitrate.
Moreover, precise timing cannot be always achieved.
When data need to be inserted at a given bitrate, the plugin tries to reach this average bitrate
(provided that there is enough stuffing) but cannot guarantee a precise constant inter-packet distance.

In broadcast streams, where the modulation parameters impose a fixed bitrate,
there is always some stuffing.
With variable bitrate, simple-program transport streams for IP, there can be no stuffing at all.

What are the options when the original amount of stuffing is not sufficient to insert the required data?
It depends on the requirements on the stream.

If the stream is targeted for broadcast, with a given target bitrate which cannot be changed,
there is no other solution than removing existing data to make room for the new data.
Some plugins such as `filter` or `svremove` delete individual PID's or complete services.
By default, the deleted packets are simply removed from the stream.
But these plugins also have a `--stuffing` option which replaces deleted packets by stuffing instead of removing them.
Thus, you can increase the stuffing bitrate without altering the global transport stream bitrate.

If there is no requirement on the global bitrate,
it is possible to insert artificial stuffing at input level using the global `tsp` option `--add-input-stuffing`.
The option adds a given number of null packets after a given number of input packets
(for instance, add 1 null packet every 15 input packets).
The parameters influence the amount and distribution of the artificial stuffing.
Do not be afraid of inserting too much stuffing.
It is always possible to remove the stuffing in excess using `-P filter -n -p 0x1FFF` at the end of the chain,
after all injection plugins.

==== Merging and forking

As indicated above, `tsp` processes one single transport stream.
However, specific plugins such as `merge` and `fork` respectively combine and duplicate transport streams.
They are designed to route transport streams from and to other applications.
When the "other" application is another instance of `tsp`, we can create complex processing graphs.

This is illustrated in the diagram below.

.Merging and forking transport streams
image::mergefork.png[align="center",alt="Merging and forking TS"]

[#joint-termination]
==== Joint termination

Some plugins have termination conditions.

For instance, the plugin `until` passes packets until some specified condition.
The plugins `mux` and `inject` may terminate `tsp` after completing the data insertion, etc.

Therefore, a plugin can decide to terminate `tsp` on its own.
The termination is unconditional, regardless of the state of the other plugins.
Thus, if several plugins have termination conditions, `tsp` stops when the first plugin decides to terminate.
In other words, there is an _or_ operator between the various termination conditions.

The idea behind _joint termination_ is to terminate `tsp` when several plugins have jointly terminated their processing.

If several plugins have a _joint termination_ condition (usually using the option `--joint-termination`),
`tsp` stops when the last plugin triggers the joint termination condition.
In other words, there is an _and_ operator between the various joint termination conditions.

Additionally, the `tsp` option `--ignore-joint-termination` disables this behavior.
When this options is used,
all plugins continue to pass packets as if some additional joint termination condition was still pending.

==== Packet labelling

Transport streams packets may receive one or more _label_ from any packet processing plugin.
A label is an integer value from 0 to 31, inclusive.
A label remains attached to the packet all along the chain, from plugin to plugin.
Later, it is possible to select packets with a label value or invoke a specific plugin only on packets having a given label.

The plugin `filter` has an option named `--set-label` to assign a label to the selected packets.
Note that, with this option, the plugin `filter` does not drop unselected packets;
it keeps all packets but assigns the specified label to the selected packets.

All packet processing plugins accept the option `--only-label` which selects only the packets with a given label.
Thus, only the packets with that label pass through the plugin.
All other packets, without that label, are directly passed to the next plugin in the chain.

The following example illustrates the usage of labels.
The first three plugins select different kinds of packets and assign a label value depending on the kind of packet.
These `filter` plugins do not drop any packet, they just assign labels to some of them.
Later, three other plugins are applied only to one of these labels.
In this example, we consequently count packets with unit start indicator and scrambling control value 2 and 3, respectively.

[source,shell]
----
$ tsp -I ... \
      -P filter --unit-start --set-label 2 \
      -P filter --scrambling 2 --set-label 10 \
      -P filter --scrambling 3 --set-label 11 \
      -P count --only-label 2 --total --tag unit \
      -P count --only-label 10 --total --tag scr2 \
      -P count --only-label 11 --total --tag scr3 \
      -O ...

* count: unit: total: counted 5,311 packets out of 5,311
* count: scr2: total: counted 8,378 packets out of 8,378
* count: scr3: total: counted 7,439 packets out of 7,439

==== Command line options

[.usage]
Global tsp options

These options apply to the execution of the `tsp` framework.
They must be placed on the command line before any plugin specification.

[.opt]
*-a* _nullpkt/inpkt_ +
*--add-input-stuffing* _nullpkt/inpkt_

[.optdoc]
Specify that `_nullpkt_` null TS packets must be automatically inserted after every `_inpkt_` input TS packets.
Both `_nullpkt_` and `_inpkt_` must be non-zero integer values.
This option is useful to artificially increase the input bitrate by adding stuffing.

[.optdoc]
Example: the option `-a 14/24` adds 14 null packets every 24 input packets,
effectively turning a 24 Mb/s input stream (terrestrial) into a 38 Mb/s stream (satellite).

[.opt]
*--add-start-stuffing* _count_

[.optdoc]
Specify that `_count_` null TS packets must be automatically inserted at the start of the processing,
before the first packet coming from the input plugin.

[.opt]
*--add-stop-stuffing* _count_

[.optdoc]
Specify that `_count_` null TS packets must be automatically inserted at the end of the processing,
after the last packet coming from the input plugin.

[.opt]
*-b* _value_ +
*--bitrate* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the transport stream input bitrate, in bits/seconds.
By default, the input bitrate is provided by the input plugin or by analysis of the PCR's at the beginning of the input stream.
If no or not enough PCR are found, the DTS from video PID's are used.

[.optdoc]
See xref:bitrates[xrefstyle=short] for more details on the representation of bitrates.

[.optdoc]
Use option `--bitrate` when you know precisely the input bitrate and you do not trust the input device, the PCR's or the DTS.

[.optdoc]
See also the plugin `pcrbitrate` for permanent recomputation of the bitrate based on PCR's or DTS.

[.opt]
*--bitrate-adjust-interval* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the interval in seconds between bitrate adjustments, ie. when the output bitrate is adjusted to the input one.
The default is 5 seconds.
Some output processors ignore this setting.
Typically, ASI or modulator devices use it, while file devices ignore it.
This option is ignored if `--bitrate` is specified.

[.opt]
*--buffer-size-mb* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the global buffer size in mega-bytes.
This is the size of the buffer between the input and output devices.
The default is 16 MB.
Increasing the buffer size may improve the performance at the expense of increasing the overall latency (implicit time-shifting).

[.optdoc]
The value (in mega-bytes) can be decimal, for instance `--buffer-size-mb 0.5`,
but note that there is no good reason to decrease the buffer size below 1 MB.

[.optdoc]
See also the options `--max-input-packets` and `--max-flushed-packets`
to adjust the latency without modifying the global buffer size.

[.opt]
*--final-wait* _milliseconds_

[.optdoc]
Wait the specified number of milliseconds after the last input packet.
Zero means wait forever.

[.opt]
*-i* +
*--ignore-joint-termination*

[.optdoc]
Ignore all `--joint-termination` options in plugins.
The plugins continue to pass packets as if some additional joint termination condition was still pending.

[.optdoc]
See the description of xref:joint-termination[joint termination] above for more details.

[.opt]
*--initial-input-packets* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the number of packets to initially read in the buffer before starting the processing.

[.optdoc]
The initial load is used to evaluate the bitrate
so that all subsequent plugins can have a valid global bitrate value from the beginning.
It is also used to make sure that the global buffer is optimally used.

[.optdoc]
The default initial load is half the size of the global buffer.
For offline files and real-time devices with a sustained bitrate, it is a good idea to keep the default value.

[.optdoc]
The side effect of waiting for a significant amount of initial packets before starting the processing is that,
with very low bitrates, `tsp` seems to do nothing until the global buffer is half full.
The option `--initial-input-packets` is used to adjust this effect when necessary.

[.optdoc]
The downside of using a lower initial buffer load is that
some plugins may not be able to use a valid bitrate for the initial part of the stream.
Another downside is that the usage of the global buffer will probably be suboptimal and may even starve,
creating output glitches, depending on the processing time of the intermediate plugins.

[.opt]
*-l* +
*--list-plugins*

[.optdoc]
List all available plugins.

[.opt]
*--log-plugin-index*

[.optdoc]
In log messages, add the plugin index to the plugin name.
This can be useful if the same plugin is used several times and all instances log many messages.

[.opt]
*--max-flushed-packets* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the maximum number of packets to be processed before flushing them to the next plugin or the output.
When the processing time is high and some packets are lost, try decreasing this value.

[.optdoc]
The offline default is 10,000 packets.
The real-time default is 1,000 packets.

[.opt]
*--max-input-packets* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the maximum number of packets to be received at a time from the input plugin.

[.optdoc]
By default, in offline mode, `tsp` reads as many packets as it can, depending on the free space in the buffer.
The real-time default is 1,000 packets.

[.opt]
*--max-output-packets* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the maximum number of packets to be sent at a time by the output plugin.

[.optdoc]
By default, `tsp` sends as many packets as available.
This option is useful only when an output plugin or a specific output device has problems with large output requests.
This option forces multiple smaller send operations.

[.opt]
**-r**__[keyword]__ +
**--realtime**__[=keyword]__

[.optdoc]
Specifies if `tsp` and all plugins should use default values for real-time or offline processing.

[.optdoc]
By default, if any plugin prefers real-time, the real-time defaults are used.
If no plugin prefers real-time, the offline default are used.

[.optdoc]
If `-r` or `--realtime` is used alone, the real-time defaults are enforced.
The explicit values `no`, `false`, `off` are used to enforce the offline defaults and
the explicit values `yes`, `true`, `on` are used to enforce the real-time defaults.

[.opt]
*--receive-timeout* _milliseconds_

[.optdoc]
Specify a timeout in milliseconds for all input operations.

[.optdoc]
Equivalent to the same `--receive-timeout` option in some input plugins.
In practice, when an input plugin natively supports a receive timeout, this global parameter is passed to the plugin.
Otherwise, `tsp` handles the receive timeout and tries to abort the stalled input operation in case of timeout.

[.optdoc]
By default, there is no input timeout.

[.usage]
Control commands options

It is possible to send commands to a running `tsp` process using the command `tspcontrol`.
See the documentation of `tspcontrol` for more details on control commands.
The following options control how these control commands are received.

[.opt]
*--control* _[address:]port_

[.optdoc]
Specify the TCP port on which `tsp` listens for control commands.
If an optional address is specified, it must be a local IP address of the system.
If unspecified, no control commands are expected.

[.opt]
*--control-certificate-path* _name_

[.optdoc]
With `--control-tls`, path to the certificate for the control commands.
See xref:opt-tls[xrefstyle=short] for more details.

[.opt]
*--control-key-path* _name_

[.optdoc]
With `--control-tls`, path to the private key for the control commands.
See xref:opt-tls[xrefstyle=short] for more details.

[.opt]
*--control-reuse-port*

[.optdoc]
With `--control`, set the reuse port socket option on the control TCP server port.

[.optdoc]
This option is not enabled by default to avoid accidentally running two identical `tsp` commands with the same control port.

[.opt]
*--control-source* _address_

[.optdoc]
With `--control`, specify a remote IP address which is allowed to send control commands.

[.optdoc]
By default, as a security precaution, without both `--control-tls` and `--control-token`,
only the local host is allowed to send control commands.

[.optdoc]
Several `--control-source` options are allowed.

[.opt]
*--control-store* _name_

[.optdoc]
With `--control-tls`, path to the certificate store for the control commands.
See xref:opt-tls[xrefstyle=short] for more details.

[.opt]
*--control-timeout* _milliseconds_

[.optdoc]
With `--control`, specify the reception timeout in milliseconds for control commands.
The default timeout is 5000 ms.

[.opt]
*--control-tls*

[.optdoc]
The control commands use a SSL/TLS TCP Web API instead of a clear TCP connection.
By default, the control commands accepts clear commands using a clear TCP connection.
See xref:opt-tls[xrefstyle=short] for more details.

[.opt]
*--control-token* _'string'_

[.optdoc]
With `--control-tls`, optional authentication token that clients are required to provide with the control commands.
See xref:opt-tls[xrefstyle=short] for more details.

[.usage]
Default values for plugins options

The following options are commonly found in many different plugins.
They typically influence the way the signalization is interpreted or generated.

These options can also be specified at `tsp` level, before specifying any plugin.
They have have no effect on the `tsp` framework.
They are only passed as initial default values for all plugins which accept the equivalent options.
Explicit options at plugin level take precedence over these global defaults.

include::{docdir}/opt/group-duck-context.adoc[tags=!*;notitle;cas;std;hf;charset;timeref;pds;fixpds]
include::{docdir}/opt/group-common-commands.adoc[tags=!*]

[.usage]
Plugin activation options

[.opt]
*-I* _name_

[.optdoc]
Designate the shared library plugin for packet input.
By default, read packets from standard input.

[.opt]
*-O* _name_

[.optdoc]
Designate the shared library plugin for packet output.
By default, write packets to standard output.

[.opt]
*-P* _name_

[.optdoc]
Designate a shared library plugin for packet processing.
Several packet processors are allowed.
Each packet is successively processed by each processor, in the order of the command line.
By default, there is no processor and the packets are directly passed from the input to the output.

The specified plugin _name_ is used to locate a shared library for the plugin
(`.so` file on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS, `.dll` on Windows).
On Windows, usually, all plugins files are in the same directory as the `tsp` executable.
More generally, a plugin can be designated in a number of ways, in the following order.
When a method fails, the next one is attempted.

* If the plugin name is a complete path name, with a directory, this path name is used.
* Without directory in the plugin name, a list of directories is searched:
** If the environment `TSPLUGINS_PATH` is defined, a list of directories is parsed.
   Directories are separated by a semicolon `;` on Windows and a colon `:` on {unix}.
** The same directory as the `tsp` executable file is used as last choice.
** In each of these directories, the file named `tsplugin_name.so` or `.dylib` or `.dll` is searched.
** If not found, the file `name` and then `name.so` or `.dylib` or `.dll` is searched.
* If still not found, the standard algorithm of the operating system is applied to locate the shared library file,
  using the specified name (on Linux, see the man page of `dlopen(3)` for more details).

The _input-options_, _processor-options_ and _output-options_, as specified in the general syntax of the `tsp` command,
are specific to their corresponding plugin.
All available plugins are documented in xref:chap-plugins[xrefstyle=short].

[.usage]
Common plugin options

All plugins accept the following common options:

[.opt]
*--help*

[.optdoc]
The plugin displays its syntax and exits.

[.optdoc]
This means that the following type of command can be used to display the help text for a specific plugin:

[source,shell]
----
$ tsp {-I|-O|-P} name --help
----

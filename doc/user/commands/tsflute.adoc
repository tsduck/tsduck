[.cmd-header]
Analyze a FLUTE stream from a pcap or pcap-ng file

FLUTE is the "File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport".
It is used by various protocols such as Multicast Adaptive Bit Rate or DVB-NIP.

The pcap file shall contain all UDP packets of a FLUTE stream.
Non-UDP packets are ignored.

NOTE: To analyze a FLUTE stream which is transported using MPE in a MPEG-2 transport stream,
use the `tsp` plugin `flute`. See xref:_flute[xrefstyle=short] for more details.

|===

Some plugins are related to the scrambling of TS packets and Conditional Access Systems.
Please note the following:

* The DVB-CSA scrambling algorithm is inherently and purposely very slow with a software implementation.
  A 3.4 GHz Pentium 4 CPU, for instance, cannot (de)scramble more than 20 Mb/s.
  Be cautious not to ask for impossible tasks, like real time (de)scrambling of a complete TS on a regular PC.
* These `tsp` plugins are implemented for testing Conditional Access Systems, either on the head-end or set-top box side.
  TSDuck does not provide any support to hack or circumvent Conditional Access Systems and will never do so.
  The CAS-related plugins require and use external CAS-provided systems (ECMG, EMMG and smartcards).
  All secrecy and proprietary CAS information remain isolated inside these external systems and
  TSDuck does not attempt to access this type of secret and private information.
  TSDuck only interacts with these systems using their external communication protocols.

[.usage]
Parameters

[.opt]
_file-name_

[.optdoc]
Name of the input files.
The files are read in sequence, unless `--interleave` is specified.

[.optdoc]
If no file is specified, the standard input is read by default.
When several files are specified, use a dash (`-`) as file name to specify the standard input.

[.usage]
Options

[.opt]
*--add-start-stuffing* _count_

[.optdoc]
Specify that _count_ null TS packets must be automatically inserted at the start of the input file,
before the first actual packet in the file.

[.optdoc]
If several input files are specified, several options `--add-start-stuffing` are allowed.
If there are less options than input files, the last value is used for subsequent files.

[.opt]
*--add-stop-stuffing* _count_

[.optdoc]
Specify that _count_ null TS packets must be automatically appended at the end of the input file,
after the last actual packet in the file.

[.optdoc]
If several input files are specified, several options `--add-stop-stuffing` are allowed.
If there are less options than input files, the last value is used for subsequent files.

[.opt]
*-b* _value_ +
*--byte-offset* _value_

[.optdoc]
Start reading each file at the specified byte offset (default: zero).
This option is allowed only if the input file is a regular file.

[.opt]
*-f* +
*--first-terminate*

[.optdoc]
With `--interleave`, terminate the processing when any file reaches the end of file.

[.optdoc]
By default, continue reading until the last file reaches the end of file
(other files are replaced with null packets after their end of file).

include::{docdir}/opt/opt-format.adoc[tags=!*;input;multiple]

[.opt]
*-i* +
*--infinite*

[.optdoc]
Repeat the playout of the file infinitely (default: only once).
This option is allowed only if the input file is a regular file and there is only one input file.

[.opt]
*--interleave[=value]*

[.optdoc]
Interleave files instead of reading them one by one.
All files are simultaneously opened.

[.optdoc]
The optional value is a chunk size _N_, a packet count (default is 1).
_N_ packets are read from the first file, then _N_ from the second file, etc.
and then loop back to _N_ packets again from the first file, etc.

[.opt]
*-l* _value_ +
*--label-base* _value_

[.optdoc]
Set a label on each input packet.
Packets from the first file are tagged with the specified base label,
packets from the second file with base label plus one, and so on.

[.optdoc]
For a given file, if the computed label is above the maximum (31), its packets are not labelled.

[.opt]
*-p* _value_ +
*--packet-offset* _value_

[.optdoc]
Start reading each file at the specified TS packet (default: zero).

[.optdoc]
This option is allowed only if all input files are regular file.

[.opt]
*-r* _count_ +
*--repeat* _count_

[.optdoc]
Repeat the playout of each file the specified number of times (default: only once).

[.optdoc]
This option is allowed only if all input files are regular files.

[.optdoc]
If several input files are specified, the first file is repeated the specified number of times,
then the second file is repeated the same number of times, and so on.

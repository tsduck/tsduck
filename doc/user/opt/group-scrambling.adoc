[.usage]
Transport stream scrambling options

[.opt]
*--aes-cbc*

[.optdoc]
Use AES-CBC scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2 (the default).

[.optdoc]
The control words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.
The residue is left clear.
Specify a fixed initialization vector using the `--iv` option.

[.optdoc]
Note that this is a non-standard TS scrambling mode.
The only standard AES-based scrambling modes are ATIS-IDSA and DVB-CISSA (DVB-CISSA is the same as AES-CBC with a DVB-defined IV).

[.optdoc]
With the plugin `scrambler`, a _scrambling_descriptor_ is automatically added to the PMT of the service
to indicate the use of AES-CBC scrambling.
Since there is no standard value for AES-CBC, the user-defined _scrambling_mode_ value 0xF0 is used.

[.opt]
*--aes-ctr*

[.optdoc]
Use AES-CTR scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2 (the default).

[.optdoc]
The control words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.
The residue is included in the scrambling.
Specify a fixed initialization vector using the `--iv` option.
See the option `--ctr-counter-bits` for the size of the counter part in the IV.

[.optdoc]
Note that this is a non-standard TS scrambling mode.
The only standard AES-based scrambling modes are ATIS-IDSA and DVB-CISSA.

WARNING: AES-CTR shall be used for experimentation only because it is completely *unsafe*
in the context of transport stream scrambling.
The CTR ("counter") mode is equivalent to a stream cipher and, therefore,
the initialization vector shall *never* be reused between messages.
This means that each message shall use its own IV, which therefore must be transmitted with the message.
In the context of TS scrambling, the message size is always fixed (the TS packet payload),
there is no room to transmit an IV with every packet and all packets are scrambled with the same IV.
With CBC-based algorithms such as DVB-CSA2, DVB-CISSA, and ATIS-IDSA, using the same IV in all packets is not ideal.
However, the risk is understood and mitigated by frequent updates of the control word.
On the other hand, with CTR-base algorithms, using the same IV for several messages
(all TS packets in a crypto-period in the TS scrambling case) is a security non-sense.

[.optdoc]
With the plugin `scrambler`, a _scrambling_descriptor_ is automatically added to the PMT of the service
to indicate the use of AES-CTR scrambling.
Since there is no standard value for AES-CTR, the user-defined _scrambling_mode_ value 0xF1 is used.

[.opt]
*--atis-idsa*

[.optdoc]
Use ATIS-IDSA descrambling (ATIS-0800006) instead of DVB-CSA2 (the default).

[.optdoc]
The control words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.

[.opt]
*--ctr-counter-bits* _value_

[.optdoc]
With `--aes-ctr`, specifies the size in bits of the counter part.

[.optdoc]
In the initialization vector, the fixed nonce part uses the first 128-N bits and the counter part uses the last N bits.

[.optdoc]
By default, the counter part uses the second half of the IV (64 bits).

[.opt]
*-c* _hexa-digits_ +
*--cw* _hexa-digits_

[.optdoc]
Specifies a fixed and constant control word for all TS packets (no crypto-period scheduling, no ECM).

[.optdoc]
The value must be a string of 16 hexadecimal digits
(32 digits with `--atis-idsa`, `--dvb-cissa`, `--aes-cbc`, `--aes-ctr`).

[.opt]
*--dvb-cissa*

[.optdoc]
Use DVB-CISSA descrambling (see <<ETSI-103-127>>) instead of DVB-CSA2 (the default).

[.optdoc]
The control words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.

[.opt]
*--dvb-csa2*

[.optdoc]
Use DVB-CSA2 descrambling.
This is the default.

[.opt]
*-f* _name_ +
*--cw-file* _name_

[.optdoc]
Specifies a text file containing the list of control words to apply.
Each line of the file must contain exactly 16 hexadecimal digits
(32 digits with `--atis-idsa`, `--dvb-cissa`, `--aes-cbc`, `--aes-ctr`).

[.optdoc]
During scrambling, the next control word is used at each start of crypto-period.
At the end of the list of control words, the list is rewound and scrambling restarts with the first one.
Using the plugin `scrambler`, scheduling crypto-periods and distinct control words is possible only when a service is specified.
If individual PID's are specifically scrambled, there is no crypto-period and only the first control word of the file is used.

[.optdoc]
During descrambling, the next control word is used
each time a new _transport_scrambling_control_ value is found in the header of a TS packet.
At the end of the list of control words, the list is rewound and descrambling restarts with the first one.

[.opt]
*--iv* _hexa-digits_

[.optdoc]
With `--aes-cbc` or `--aes-ctr`, specifies a fixed initialization vector for all TS packets.

[.optdoc]
The value must be a string of 32 hexadecimal digits.
The default IV is all zeroes.

[.opt]
*-n* +
*--no-entropy-reduction*

[.optdoc]
Do not perform DVB-CSA2 control word entropy reduction to 48 bits, keep full 64-bit control words.
This option is ignored with other encryption algorithms.

[.opt]
*--output-cw-file* _name_

[.optdoc]
Specifies a text file to create with all control words.
Each line of the file will contain a control word with 16 or 32 hexadecimal digits, depending on the scrambling algorithm.
Each time a new control word is used to scramble or descramble packets, it is logged in the file.

[.optdoc]
During scrambling, this option is specifically useful when the control words are dynamically extracted from ECM's.
The created file can be used later using `--cw-file` to perform a direct descrambling test.

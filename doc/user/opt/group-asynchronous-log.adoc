[.usage]
Asynchronous logging options

This application is multi-threaded.
Each thread may log messages at any time.
To avoid delaying an application thread, the messages are displayed asynchronously in a low priority thread.

[.opt]
*--log-message-count* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify the maximum number of buffered log messages.
This value specifies the maximum number of buffered log messages in memory, before being displayed.
When too many messages are logged in a short period of time, while plugins use all CPU power,
the low-priority log thread has no resource.
If it cannot display on time, the buffered messages and extra messages are dropped.
Increase this value if you think that too many messages are dropped.

[.opt]
*-s* +
*--synchronous-log*

[.optdoc]
With this option, each logged message is guaranteed to be displayed, synchronously, without any loss of message.
The downside is that an application thread may be blocked for a short while when too many messages are logged.

[.opt]
// tag::short-t[]
*-t* +
// end::short-t[]
*--timed-log*

[.optdoc]
Each logged message contains a timestamp.

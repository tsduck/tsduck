[.usage]
Parameters

[.opt]
_file-name_

[.optdoc]
Name of the created output file.

[.optdoc]
If the parameter is omitted, is an empty string or a dash (`-`), the standard output is used.

[.optdoc]
If no file is specified, the standard input is read by default.
When several files are specified, use a dash (`-`) as file name to specify the standard input.

[.usage]
Options

[.opt]
*--add-start-stuffing* _count_

[.optdoc]
Specify that _count_ null TS packets must be automatically written at the start of the output file,
before what comes from the previous plugins.

[.opt]
*--add-stop-stuffing* _count_

[.optdoc]
Specify that _count_ null TS packets must be automatically appended at the end of the output file,
after what comes from the previous plugins.

[.opt]
*-a* +
*--append*

[.optdoc]
If the file already exists, append to the end of the file.
By default, existing files are overwritten.

include::{docdir}/opt/opt-format.adoc[tags=!*;output]

[.opt]
*-k* +
*--keep*

[.optdoc]
Keep existing file (abort if the specified file already exists).
By default, existing files are overwritten.

[.opt]
*--max-duration* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify a maximum duration in seconds during which an output file is written.
After the specified duration, the output file is closed and another one is created.
This is a wall-clock processing duration, not a transport stream playout duration.

[.optdoc]
A timestamp is automatically added to the name part so that successive output files receive distinct names.

[.optdoc]
Example: if the specified output file name is `foo.ts`, the various files are named `foo-YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.ts`.

[.optdoc]
The options `--max-duration` and `--max-size` are mutually exclusive.

[.opt]
*--max-files* _value_

[.optdoc]
With `--max-duration` or `--max-size`, specify a maximum number of files.
When the number of created files exceeds the specified number, the oldest files are deleted.

[.optdoc]
By default, all created files are kept.

[.opt]
*--max-retry* _value_

[.optdoc]
With `--reopen-on-error`, specify the maximum number of times the file is reopened on error.

[.optdoc]
By default, the file is indefinitely reopened.

[.opt]
*--max-size* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specify a maximum size in bytes for the output files
When an output file grows beyond the specified limit, it is closed and another one is created.

[.optdoc]
The size limit is not exactly enforced.
When a group of packets is written in one single write operation,
there is no attempt to split the file at the exact specified size.
The file is closed and the next one is opened after all packets are written in that single write operation.

[.optdoc]
A number is automatically added to the name part so that successive output files receive distinct names.

[.optdoc]
Example: if the specified file name is `foo.ts`, the various files are named `foo-000000.ts`, `foo-000001.ts`, etc.

[.optdoc]
If the specified template already contains trailing digits, this unmodified name is used for the first file.
Then, the integer part is incremented.

[.optdoc]
Example: if the specified file name is `foo-027.ts`, the various files are named `foo-027.ts`, `foo-028.ts`, etc.

[.optdoc]
The options `--max-duration` and `--max-size` are mutually exclusive.

[.opt]
*-r* +
*--reopen-on-error*

[.optdoc]
In case of write error, close the file and try to reopen it several times.
After a write error, attempt to reopen or recreate the file immediately.
Then, in case of open error, periodically retry to open the file.

[.optdoc]
See also options `--retry-interval` and `--max-retry`.

[.opt]
*--retry-interval* _milliseconds_

[.optdoc]
With `--reopen-on-error`, specify the number of milliseconds to wait before attempting to reopen the file after a failure.

[.optdoc]
The default is 2000 milliseconds.

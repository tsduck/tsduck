== Transport Stream Toolkit Overview

=== Operating system selection guidelines

TSDuck runs on Linux, Windows, macOS and BSD systems.
Here is a brief summary of pros and cons of using TSDuck on the various operating systems.

* Linux pros:
** Availability of a powerful shell environment. TSDuck is a lightweight toolkit with elementary
   tools and plugins which can be combined in an infinite number of ways.
   The user can obtain even more flexibility when combining them with the bash shell and all standard
   UNIX utilities (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`, etc.) See some complex examples in xref:tsp-examples[xrefstyle=short].
* Linux cons:
** When used in a mobile environment, a laptop PC with Linux is required.
** Some DVB tuners are not supported on Linux.
   Some supported tuners do not work well on Linux.
   Make sure to get fully supported DVB hardware.
* Windows pros:
** Available on all "average user" laptop PC. Useful for transport stream capture and analysis in the field.
* Windows cons:
** No or limited shell environment.
** Some limitations in the support of hardware DVB/ATSC/ISDB tuner devices
   (see xref:tuners-windows[xrefstyle=short], for more details).
   The development of the DirectShow framework which supports these tuners seems stopped.
   Recent modulation schemes are not supported.
* macOS pros:
** Availability of a powerful shell environment, just another UNIX system, just like Linux.
   Powerful user-friendly system.
* macOS cons:
** Currently no support for hardware tuners and Dektec devices.
   So, macOS is recommended only when dealing with transport stream files, IP networking or VATek-based modulators.
* BSD systems: For aficionados only.

*Summary*: Use Linux if you can.
Use Windows when you do not have Linux (typically a Windows laptop in the field).
Use macOS if you have a Mac and do not need DVB or Dektec hardware.

=== Developing applications using the TSDuck library

TSDuck is mainly a large {cpp} library for Digital TV applications.
All TSDuck commands and plugins are thin wrappers on top of {cpp} classes from this library.

This library can be used by third-party applications, outside the TSDuck tools and plugins.
To do that, you must install the "TSDuck development environment".

Using the TSDuck library, you can develop independent Digital TV applications or TSDuck plugins.
The provided services include low-level features such as manipulating TS packets, intermediate
features such as demuxing and packetizing tables and high-level features such as running TS
processing pipelines inside your application (which means something like including `tsp` in your application).

See the Developer's Guide <<TSDuck-Dev>> and the Programming Reference <<TSDuck-Prog>>
for more details on the TSDuck library. The latter is a set of doxygen-generated pages with
reference documentation for all {cpp} classes in the library.

Some high-level features of the TSDuck library can also be used from Python or Java, typically running
TS processing pipelines or manipulating tables and sections inside Python or Java applications.
The TSDuck Python and Java bindings are also documented in <<TSDuck-Prog>>.

The following figure illustrates the TSDuck software and how it can interact with third-party applications.

=== Installing TSDuck

The TSDuck installers are available from the "Download" section of the TSDuck Web site (see <<TSDuck>>).
The basic installation provides all TSDuck tools and plugins.
The command-line tools are directly accessible from the command prompt.

==== Windows

On Windows systems, TSDuck can be setup using a binary installer (traditional method) or
using the `winget` package manager (modern method).
Winget is now the preferred package manager for open source and third-party products on Windows systems.
It is documented and supported by Microsoft.
It should be pre-installed on all recent Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems.

The TSDuck installation command is simply:

[source,powershell]
----
C:\> winget install tsduck
----

If you prefer the traditional method, binary executable installers are provided for 64-bit Windows platforms,
Intel and Arm. Simply run the executable to install TSDuck.

The directory containing the command-line tools is automatically added to the Path.
The TSDuck development environment is included in the installer but it is not installed by default.
You must select it explicitly.
The Java and Python bindings are required to run Java or Python applications.
They are also optional and must be selected when needed.

Note that TSDuck is supported for Windows 10 and 11 only.
TSDuck may work on older versions such as Windows 7 but without guarantee.

For users without privilege, a so-called "portable package" is provided.
This is simply a zip archive file which can be expanded anywhere.
The TSDuck commands are located in the `bin` subdirectory and can be executed from here without any additional setup.
It is probably a good idea to add this `bin` directory in the `Path` environment variable of the user.

*Note*: Starting with version 3.34, pre-built 32-bit installers for Windows are no longer provided.
However, it is still possible to build them yourself if needed.
See the chapter xref:tsduck-dev.html#chap-build["building and installing TSDuck"] section in <<TSDuck-Dev>>.

==== Linux

Two flavors of pre-built packages are available: `.rpm` for Fedora or Red Hat systems
and `.deb` for Ubuntu or Debian systems.
Currently, packages are available for Intel x64 and Arm64 platforms.
Some packages are also available for RISC-V and IBM s390x.

All tools are in `/usr/bin`.
There is a separate package for the TSDuck development environment.

On Linux distributions with other packaging systems, there is no pre-built binary package for TSDuck.
It must be compiled and installed using the `make` command.
See the chapter xref:tsduck-dev.html#chap-build["building and installing TSDuck"] section in <<TSDuck-Dev>>.

==== macOS

On macOS, TSDuck is installed using the Homebrew packaging and delivery system (see <<HomeBrew>>).

The TSDuck installation command is simply:

[source,shell]
----
$ brew install tsduck
----

All tools are accessible from `/usr/local/bin` (Intel Mac) or `/opt/homebrew/bin` (Arm Apple Silicon Mac).
This is the standard installation structure for Homebrew.

The development environment is always installed with TSDuck using Homebrew.

==== BSD systems

There is no binary package for TSDuck on BSD systems.
It must be compiled and installed using the make command.
See the chapter xref:tsduck-dev.html#chap-build["building and installing TSDuck"] section in <<TSDuck-Dev>>.

After installation, all tools are in `/usr/local/bin` for FreeBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD.
They are in `/usr/pkg/bin` for NetBSD.
These are the standard locations for the installed packages on these systems.

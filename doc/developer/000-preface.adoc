== Preface

TSDuck is a free and open-source toolkit to manipulate MPEG Transport Streams.

As a product, TSDuck provides many different command-line tools and plugins.
Internally, the architecture of TSDuck is made of a large shareable library
(`tsduck.dll` on Windows, `libtsduck.so` on Linux and BSD systems, `libtsduck.dylib` on macOS).
Most of the valuable processing is performed by the various {cpp} classes from the TSDuck library.
All command-line tools and plugins are usually small wrappers around this library.

The TSDuck library offers generic {cpp} classes as well as specialized classes for MPEG transport streams.
This library can be used as a general-purpose {cpp} library for third-party applications, outside the TSDuck tools and plugins.

The following figure illustrates the TSDuck software architecture and how it interacts with third-party applications.

This document is the TSDuck Developer Guide.
It can be equally used by TSDuck maintainers and developers of third-party applications.

Structure of this guide:

* The xref:chap-build[xrefstyle=short] describes how to build and install TSDuck.
  This section is especially useful on platforms for which there is not pre-built binary package.
  TSDuck users should read this chapter to build and install TSDuck on their system.
* The xref:chap-application[xrefstyle=short] is an introduction for developers who
  use the TSDuck library in their application, outside TSDuck itself.
* The xref:chap-contribution[xrefstyle=short] is a guide for advanced users who wish to
  contribute to TSDuck development, submit new features, improvements, or bug fixes.
* The xref:chap-maintenance[xrefstyle=short] is a reference section for TSDuck maintainers.
  It describes how the code is organized, the test and delivery processes, the automation
  of the project.
* The xref:coding[xrefstyle=short] lists the coding guidelines which are used in the development of TSDuck.
  All maintainers and contributors are required to follow these guidelines.

In addition to this developer guide, a comprehensive
{home}doxy/[reference programming documentation] is available online.
It documents all TSDuck public {cpp} classes, as well as the Python and Java API's.
This is a reference documentation which is automatically generated from the source files
using https://doxygen.nl/[doxygen].

License

TSDuck is released under the terms of the license which is commonly referred to as
"BSD 2-Clause License" or "Simplified BSD License" or "FreeBSD License".
This is a liberal license which allows TSDuck to be used in a large number of environments.
See the xref:chap-license[xrefstyle=short] for more details.

[.usage]
Documentation format

The TSDuck developer guide is built using https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor],
from a set of text files which are maintained alongside the source code, in the same `git` repository.

This guide is formatted for HTML.
The file `tsduck-dev.html` is monolithic and self-sufficient, without reference to external images.
Therefore, this HTML file can be downloaded, saved, and copied, as long as the license and content are not modified.

A PDF version xref:tsduck-dev.pdf[] is also available.
However, due to limitations in the PDF generator of asciidoctor, the rendering is sometimes not as good as the HTML document.

The TSDuck documentation set is made of:

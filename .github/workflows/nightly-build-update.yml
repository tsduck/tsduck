#  GitHub Actions configuration file : Nightly builds update
#
#  The "nightly build" workflow runs every night at 01:10 GMT. It builds
#  installers and documentations and uploads them as artifacts. These
#  artifacts are made available only when the "nightly build" workflow
#  completes. The present workflow runs three hours after "nightly build".
#  We expect the artifacts to be available at that time. This workflow
#  triggers an action at tsduck.io which downloads the new installers and
#  documentation and make them available on the Web site.

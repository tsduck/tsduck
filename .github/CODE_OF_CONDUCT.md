# Code of conduct

TSDuck is an open source project for all digital television engineers and hobbyists.
It is primarily designed for test, monitoring, integration, debug, lab, demo or
any other kind of experimentation.

## Openness on contributions and discussion

TSDuck is [open for contributions](https://tsduck.io/docs/tsduck-dev.html#chap-contribution).

The [issues](https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck/issues) area on GitHub can be
freely used for questions or discussions about TSDuck or digital television
topics where TSDuck can be used. Specifically, unlike many projects which are
hosted on GitHub, the issue area is not limited to reporting problems.

As usual in any civilized discussion forum, be polite and benevolent.
Aggressivity and insults are not tolerated.

## Ban on Pay-TV piracy

TSDuck can be extremely useful in the domain of Pay-TV. As a toolbox, it can
be used for many different purposes. It must be clear that TSDuck is developed
by TV engineers for TV engineers, not for hackers who want to circumvent
protection systems such as Conditional Access Systems (CAS) or Digital
Rights Managers (DRM). To be even more clear, the author of
TSDuck has been working in the CAS and DRM industry for more than twenty
years and will never support piracy in any form.

__Important:__ Discussions on television piracy, hacking systems or any
support to systems the purpose of which is to deprive legitimate content
rights owners of their revenue is strictly forbidden. Authors of such
topics will be banned from the discussion forum and their messages will
be deleted.
